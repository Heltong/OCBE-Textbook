[We know that HCl (pKa -7) is a stronger acid than HF (pKa 3.2), so the
equilibrium for the reaction lies on the product side: the reaction is
exergonic, and a 'driving force' pushes reactant to product.

[Now, back to our discussion of the electrophile in an S<sub>N</sub>1
reaction: [413](#_Toc80709070)](#_Toc80709070)

[S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions in general *do not* occur at methyl or primary
carbon electrophiles: the carbocation intermediates involved would be
too unstable and the rate-determining (carbocation-generating) step
would have a very high energy barrier. Substitution on these
electrophiles will occur through the S<sub>N</sub>2 pathway.
