<h1>Interchapter: Predicting metabolic pathways<a class="headerlink" href="#interchapter-predicting-metabolic-pathways" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>Imagine that you are a biological chemist doing research on bacterial
metabolism. You and your colleagues isolate an interesting biomolecule
from a bacterial culture, then use mass spectrometry, NMR, and other
analytical techniques to determine its structure. Using your ‘toolbox’
of known organic reaction types - nucleophilic substitution,
phosphorylation, aldol additions, and so forth - can you figure out a
chemically reasonable pathway by which your compound might be
enzymatically synthesized from simple metabolic precursors? In other
words, can you fill in the missing biochemical steps (or at least some
of them) to come up with a potential new metabolic pathway, which can
then be used a hypothesis for future experimental work to try to find
and study the actual enzymes involved?</p>
<p>An actual example approximating this scenario is shown below. A complete
biosynthetic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), the building
block molecule for all isoprenoid compounds (section 1.3A), has been
known since the 1960’s. This pathway, which begins with acetyl-CoA, was
shown to be active in yeast, plants, and many other species including
humans. However, researchers in the late 1980s uncovered evidence
indicating that the known pathway is <em>not</em> present in bacteria, although
they clearly use IPP as a building block molecule just as other forms of
life do.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3321.png" src="../_images/image3321.png" /></p>
<p>fig 1a</p>
<p>Over the next several years, the researchers conducted a number of
experiments in which bacteria were grown on a medium containing glucose
‘labeled’ with the <sup>13</sup>C isotope. With the results from these
experiments, combined with their knowledge of common biological organic
reaction types, the researchers were able to correctly predict that the
bacterial pathway starts with <em>two</em> precursor molecules (pyruvate and
glyceraldehyde phosphate instead of acetyl CoA) and they also correctly
predicted the first two enzymatic steps of the newly discovered
bacterial pathway. This accomplishment eventually led to elucidation of
every step in the pathway, and isolation of the enzymes catalyzing them.
(<em>Biochem J</em>. <strong>1993</strong>, <em>295</em>, 517; <em>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</em> <strong>1996</strong>, <em>118</em>,
2564; <em>Lipids</em> <strong>2008</strong>, <em>43</em>, 1095)</p>
<p><em>Why weren’t they able to predict the whole pathway? It turns out that
several of the later steps were somewhat unusual, unfamiliar reaction
types - but discovery of these reactions hinged upon the correct
prediction of the more familiar first two steps.</em></p>
<p>Multi-step transformation problems of this type offer an unparalleled
opportunity to use our knowledge of biological organic chemistry
combined with creative reasoning to solve challenging, relevant
scientific puzzles. At this point in your organic chemistry career, you
have not yet accumulated quite enough tools in your reaction toolbox to
tackle most real-life biochemical pathway problems such as the one
addressed above - but by the time we finish with oxidation and reduction
chemistry in chapter 15, you will be able to recognize most of the
reaction types that you will encounter in real metabolism, and will be
challenged to predict some real pathways in the end-of-chapter problems.</p>
<p>You do, however, have <em>right now</em> enough of a bioorganic repertoire to
begin to learn how multi-step pathway problems can be approached, using
for practice some generalized, hypothetical examples in which the
reaction types involved are limited to those with which you are already
familiar.</p>
<p>Imagine that you want to figure out how an old-fashioned mechanical
clock is put together. One way to do this is to start with a working
clock, and take it apart piece-by-piece. Alternatively, one could start
with all of the disassembled pieces, plus a lot of other small parts
from different clocks, and try to figure out how to put together the
specific clock you are interested in. Which approach is easier? The
answer is intuitively obvious - it’s usually easier to take things apart
than to put them back together.</p>
<p>The same holds true for molecules. If we want to figure out the
biosynthetic pathway by which a large, complex biomolecule might be made
in a cell, it makes sense to start with the finished product and then
mentally work backwards, taking it apart step-by-step using known,
familiar reactions, until we get to simpler precursor molecules.
Starting with a large collection of potential precursor molecules and
trying to put the right ones together to make the target product would
be a formidable task.</p>
<p><strong>Retrosynthetic analysis</strong> - the concept of mentally dismantling a
molecule step by step all the way back to smaller, simpler precursors
using known reactions - is a powerful and widely-used intellectual tool
first developed by synthetic organic chemists. The approach has also
been adapted for use by biological chemists in efforts to predict
pathways by which known biomolecules could be synthesized (or degraded)
in living things.</p>
<p>In retrosynthesis, we think about a series of reactions in reverse. A
backwards (retro) chemical step is symbolized by a ‘thick’ arrow,
commonly referred to as a <strong>retrosynthetic arrow</strong>, and visually conveys
the phrase ‘<em>can be formed from</em>’.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3331.png" src="../_images/image3331.png" /></p>
<p>fig 2a</p>
<p>Consider a simple, hypothetical example: starting with the target
molecule below, can we come up with a chemically reasonable pathway
starting from the precursors indicated?</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3341.png" src="../_images/image3341.png" /></p>
<p>fig 2b</p>
<p>A first step is to identify the relevant <strong>disconnection</strong>: a key bond
(usually a carbon-carbon bond) that must be formed to make the target
product from smaller precursors. We search our mental ‘toolbox’ of
common biochemical reaction types, and remember that the only way we
know of (so far!) to make a new carbon-carbon bond is through an aldol
addition reaction, which takes place at an α-carbon. Therefore, we can
make a likely disconnection next to the α-carbon in the target molecule.</p>
<p>Next, we need to recognize that the aldol addition reaction results in a
β-hydroxy ketone. But our target molecule is a β-<em>methoxy</em> ketone!
Working backwards, we realize that the β-methoxy group could be formed
from a β-hydroxy group by a SAM methylation reaction (section 8.8A).
This is our first retrosynthetic (backwards) step.</p>

<p>fig 2c</p>
<p>The second retro step (aldol) accounts for the disconnection we
recognized earlier, and leads to the two precursor molecules.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3361.png" src="../_images/image3361.png" /></p>
<p>fig 2d</p>
<p>Now, consider the more involved (but still hypothetical) biochemical
transformation below:</p>
<img alt="../_images/image3371.png" src="../_images/image3371.png" />
<p>fig 3</p>
<p>Often the best thing to do first in this type of problem is to count the
carbons in the precursor compounds and product - this allows us to
recognize when extra carbons on either side must at some point be
accounted for in our solution. In this case, one carbon (labeled ‘f’’)
has been <em>gained</em> in the form of a methyl ether in the product. This is
easy to account for: we know that the coenzyme <em>S</em>-adenosyl methionine
(SAM - section 8.8A) often serves as the methyl group donor in enzymatic
<em>O</em>- or <em>N</em>-methylation reactions. So, we can propose our first
backwards (retro) step: the product as shown could be derived from
SAM-dependent methylation of an alcohol group on a proposed intermediate
I.</p>
<p><u>Retrosynthetic step 1:</u></p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3381.png" src="../_images/image3381.png" /></p>
<p>fig 4</p>
<p>How do we know that the methylation step occurs last? We don’t -
remember, we are proposing a <em>potential</em> pathway, so the best we can do
is propose steps that make chemical sense, and which hopefully can be
confirmed or invalidated later through actual experimentation. For now,
we’ll stick with our initial choice to make the methylation step the
last one.</p>
<p>Now that we have accounted for the extra carbon, a key thing to
recognize regarding the transformation in question is that two linear
molecules are combining to form a cyclic product. Thus, <em>two</em>
connections need to be made between reactants A and B, one to join the
two, the other to close the circle. Our primary job in the retro
direction, then, is to establish in the product the two points of
<em>disconnection</em>: in other words, to find the two bonds in the product
that need to be taken apart in our retrosynthetic analysis. Look closely
at the product: what functional groups do you see? Hopefully, you can
identify two alcohol groups, a methyl ether, and (critically) a <em>cyclic
hemiketal</em>. We’ve already accounted for the methyl ether. Identifying
the cyclic hemiketal is important because it allows us to make our next
‘disconnection’: we know how a hemiketal forms from a ketone and an
alcohol (section 10.2), so we can mentally work backwards and predict
the open-chain intermediate II that could cyclize to form our product.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3391.png" src="../_images/image3391.png" /></p>
<p>fig 5</p>
<p>Now, starting with the R<sub>1</sub> group and working along the carbon
chain, we can account for carbons a-e on the two precursors.</p>
<img alt="../_images/image3401.png" src="../_images/image3401.png" />
<p>fig 5a</p>
<p>Thus, <em>the next disconnection is between carbons b and c.</em> Here’s where
our mastery of biological organic reactivity really comes into play: the
OH at carbon c of intermediate II is in the β position relative to
carbonyl carbon a. Aldol addition reactions (section 12.3) result in
β-hydroxy ketones or aldehydes. Therefore, we can work backward one more
step and predict that our intermediate II was formed from an aldol
addition reaction between intermediate III (as the nucleophile) and
precursor molecule A (as the electrophile).</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3411.png" src="../_images/image3411.png" /></p>
<p>fig 6</p>
<p>We are most of the way home - we have successfully accounted for given
precursor A.</p>
<p>Intermediate III, however, is <em>not</em> precursor B. What is different? Both
III and B have a carbonyl and two alcohol groups, but the positioning is
different: III is an aldehyde, while B is a ketone. Think back to
earlier in this chapter: intermediate III could form from isomerization
of the carbonyl group in compound B (section 12.2A). We have now
accounted for our second precursor - we are done!</p>

<p>In the forward direction, a complete pathway diagram can be written as
follows:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3431.png" src="../_images/image3431.png" /></p>

<p>A full ‘retrosynthesis’ diagram for this problem looks like this:</p>

<p>In the multi-step pathway prediction problems that you will be asked to
solve below and in the remainder of this book, you will be instructed to
present your solution in the form of a proposed ‘forward’ pathway
diagram, showing the participation of all coenzymes and other species
such as water. At first, we’ll start with relatively simple,
hypothetical biochemical transformations. As you learn more reaction
types in chapter 13-17, the range and complexity of problems that you
will be able to solve will expand correspondingly, and you will
eventually be able to tackle real-life pathways.</p>
<section id="problems">
<h2>Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#problems" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>For each transformation below, draw a pathway diagram illustrating a
potential biosynthetic pathway. Indicate other molecules participating
in the reaction but not shown below (eg. coenzymes, water, etc.). Each
step should be recognizable as a reaction type that we have covered
through the end of chapter 12. (Note - you are being asked to draw your
pathways in the ‘forward’ direction, but you should attack each problem
using a retrosynthetic analysis strategy).</p>
<p><em>Solutions to these problems are available in ‘Solutions to In-Chapter
Exercises’.</em></p>
