<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of things that can kill you in northern Australia. On
land, there is the death adder, the tiger snake and the redback spider;
in the water, you’d be well advised to give wide berth to the salt water
crocodile, the stonefish, the great white shark, and of course, the
duck-billed platypus.</p>
<p>The duck-billed platypus?</p>
<p>Consider this: in 1991, a man fishing a river in northern Queensland,
Australia happened across a platypus sitting on a log. Thinking it was
injured, he picked it up. For his trouble, he spent the next six days in
a nearby hospital, suffering from two puncture wounds in his right hand
that resulted in “immediate, sustained, and devastating” pain, against
which the usual analgesic drugs were almost completely useless. His hand
“remained painful, swollen and with little movement for three weeks.
Significant functional impairment … persisted for three months”.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, deep in the rain forests
that straddle the border between eastern Peru and Brazil, a young man of
the Matses tribe prepares himself to receive the ‘hunting magic’. He
holds the end of a short wooden stick in a fire for a few minutes, then
removes it and presses the red-hot end into the skin of his chest,
holding it there for long enough for the skin to be burned. Then he
scrapes the burned skin away, and rubs into the wound a paste made from
saliva mixed with secretions taken from the skin of a giant leaf frog.</p>
<p>An American journalist named Peter Gorman, who reports having had the
frog-skin paste administered in the same manner during a visit to a
Matses village, describes what happens next:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Instantly my body began to heat up. In seconds I was burning from the
inside … I began to sweat. My blood began to race. My heart
pounded. I became acutely aware of every vein and artery in my body
and could feel them opening to allow for the fantastic pulse of my
blood. My stomach cramped and I vomited violently. I lost control of
my bodily functions… (and) fell to the ground. Then, unexpectedly,
I found myself growling and moving about on all fours. I felt as
though animals were passing through me, trying to express themselves
through my body.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After the immediate violent effects pass, the Matses hunter is carried
by his friends to a hammock to recover. After sleeping for a day, he
awakens to find himself with what his people call the ‘hunting magic’: a
state of heightened awareness, possessed of tremendous energy and an
abnormally keen sense of vision, hearing and smell. In the words of Mr.
Gorman, “everything about me felt larger than life, and my body felt
immensely strong… [I was] beginning to feel quite godlike”.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There is a connection between the killer platypus in Australia and the
‘hunting magic’ in the Amazon, and it has to do with the structure and
reactivity of what organic chemists refer to as the <strong>α-carbon</strong>: the
carbon atom positioned adjacent to a carbonyl or imine group in an
organic molecule:</p>
<img alt="../_images/image2741.png" src="../_images/image2741.png" />
<p>fig 1a</p>
<p>It is this chemistry that we are going to be studying for the next two
chapters. But first, let’s go back to that river in northern Australia
and the fisherman who apparently didn’t pay enough attention in his high
school wildlife biology class.</p>
<p>The platypus, along with a few species of shrews and moles, is an
example of a very rare phenomenon in nature: a venomous mammal. The male
platypus possesses a pair of sharp spurs on each of his hind legs near
the ankle. These spurs are hollow, and connected by a duct to a
venom-producing gland in the thigh. The consensus among scientists who
study the platypus is that males use their venomous barbs mainly when
fighting each other over territory during mating season. Because healthy
animals are often found with multiple scars from spur wounds, a platypus
who gets spurred during a fight with a rival will not always die, but
the experience is unpleasant enough that he will start looking for real
estate a healthy distance down the river.</p>
<p>It is not easy to milk the venom from an angry, thrashing platypus, but
there are scientists out there who have done it. It turns out that, like
snake and spider venom, the venom from a platypus spur consists of a
mixture of neuroactive peptides (peptides are very short proteins - less
than 50 amino acids long). Recently, a team of biochemists from the
Universities of Sydney, Queensland, and Adelaide reported that they were
able to isolate from platypus venom two forms of a 39-amino acid
peptide. Further analysis using NMR and mass spectrometry revealed that
the two forms of the peptide differed in structure only at a single
amino acid: the leucine at the #2 position. In one form, the leucine
had the L configuration (or <em>S</em> if using the <em>R/S</em> system), just like
the amino acids in virtually all other peptides and proteins found in
nature. In the other form, this leucine had the unusual D, or <em>R</em>
configuration.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2751.png" src="../_images/image2751.png" /></p>
<p>fig 1a</p>
<p>Peptides or proteins incorporating D-amino acids are not unheard of in
nature, but this was the first time that one had been found in a mammal.
Interestingly, the venom from certain marine cone snails and spiders -
and, yes, the skin of the giant leaf frog in the Amazon rain forest -
also contain neuroactive peptides with D-amino acids.</p>
<p>What is the advantage - to a platypus, cone snail, spider, or frog - of
making a venomous peptide with <em>D</em> stereochemistry on one or more of its
amino acids? It all has to do with <em>generating diversity of shape and
function</em>. These are neuroactive peptides: each one interacts in a very
specific way with a specific neural protein, thus exerting a specific
neurological effect on the person or animal exposed to the venom. The
different spatial arrangement of atoms about the α-carbon of D- and
L-amino acids will cause a peptide with a D-leucine at position #2, for
example, to fold into a different shape than its counterpart with an
L-leucine at the same position. Thus, the two peptides may bind
differently to one or more proteins in the nervous system, and
ultimately may exert different neurological effects - such as intense
pain in the case of playpus venom, or the ‘hunting magic’ effect in the
case of the peptide from frog skin. The ability to incorporate D-amino
acids greatly expands the potential structural and functional diversity
of these short peptides.</p>
<p>The two stereoisomeric platypus venom peptides are encoded by the same
gene. The peptides are initially synthesized using all <em>L</em>-amino acids,
and then the leucine at position #2 undergoes a ‘post-translational
modification’: in other words, a specific enzyme binds the all-<em>L</em>
peptide <em>after</em> it has been synthesized on the ribosome and changes the
leucine residue to the <em>D</em> configuration.</p>
<p>It is this reaction - a stereoisomerization reaction that takes place at
the α-carbon of an amino acid - that brings us to the central topic of
this chapter and the next: chemistry at the α-carbon. The key concept to
recall from what we have learned about acidity and basicity in organic
chemistry, and to keep in mind throughout this discussion, is that
α-protons (in other words, protons on α-carbons) are weakly acidic. Loss
of an α-proton forms an <strong>enolate</strong> - a species in which a negative
formal charge is delocalized between a carbon and an oxygen. The
‘enolate’ term will be very important in the next two chapters, because
most of the reactions we see will go through an enolate intermediate.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2761.png" src="../_images/image2761.png" /></p>
<p>fig 1d</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will first see several examples of isomerization
reactions, in which an enzyme acts at the α-carbon of a substrate to
catalyze the interconversion of two constitutional isomers or
stereoisomers. Then, we will be introduced to a reaction type known as
the ‘aldol addition’ and its reverse counterpart, the ‘retro-aldol’
cleavage reaction. Up to now, we have seen plenty of reactions where
bonds were formed and broken between carbon and oxygen, nitrogen, or
sulfur. Here, for the first time, we will see how enzymes can catalyze
the formation or cleavage - again, at the α position - of
<em>carbon-carbon</em> bonds: in other words, we will learn how an α-carbon can
be either a nucleophile or a leaving group in an enzymatic reaction.
This has clear importance for an understanding of metabolism in living
things: the molecules of life, after all, are built upon a framework of
carbon-carbon bonds, and metabolism is the process by which living cells
build up and break down complex biomolecules.</p>
<p>It all starts with the α-carbon - and as both the Australian fisherman
and the Amazonian hunter could attest, what happens at the α-carbon can
have some rather dramatic consequences.</p>

<section id="review-of-acidity-at-the-carbon">
<h2>12.1: Review of acidity at the α-carbon<a class="headerlink" href="#review-of-acidity-at-the-carbon" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s review what we learned in section 7.6A about the acidity of a
proton on an α-carbon and the structure of the relevant conjugate base,
the enolate ion. Remember that this acidity can be explained by the fact
that the negative charge on the enolate conjugate base is delocalized by
resonance to both the α-carbon <em>and</em> the carbonyl oxygen.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2771.png" src="../_images/image2771.png" /></p>
<p>fig 1b</p>
<p>The α-carbon on the enolate is <em>sp<sup>2</sup></em>-hybridized with trigonal
planar geometry, as are the carbonyl carbon and oxygen atoms (now would
be a good time to go back to sections 2.1C, 2.2B, and 2.3B to review, if
necessary, the geometry of π-bonding in conjugated systems). The pKa of
a typical α-proton in aqueous solution is approximately 18-20: acidic,
but only weakly so. Recall from section 7.8, however, that the
<em>effective</em> pKa of a functional group on an enzyme-bound molecule can be
altered dramatically by the ‘microenvironment’ of the active site. In
order to lower the pKa of an α−proton, an enzyme catalyzing a reaction
that begins with an α-proton abstraction step must further stabilize the
negative charge that develops on the oxygen atom of the (enolate)
conjugate base. Different enzymes have evolved different strategies for
accomplishing this task: in some cases, a metal cation (often
Zn<sup>+2</sup>) is bound in the active site to provide a stabilizing
ion-ion interaction. In other cases, stabilization is provided by a
proton-donating group positioned near the oxygen. As a third
possibility, the active site architecture sometimes provides one or more
stabilizing hydrogen bond donor groups.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2781.png" src="../_images/image2781.png" /></p>
<p>fig 1e</p>
<p>In most of the mechanism illustrations in this chapter where an enolate
intermediate is depicted, stabilizing metal ions or hydrogen bond
interactions will not be explicitly drawn, for the sake of clarity.
However, whenever you see an enolate intermediate in an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction, you should remember that there are stabilizing interactions in
play inside the active site.</p>

<h2>12.2: Isomerization at the α-carbon<a class="headerlink" href="#isomerization-at-the-carbon" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Enolate ions, as well as enols and and enamines (section 7.6) are the
key reactive intermediates in many biochemical isomerization reactions.
Isomerizations can involve either the interconversion of constitutional
isomers, in which bond connectivity is altered, or of stereoisomers,
where the stereochemical configuration is changed. Enzymes that
interconvert constitutional isomers are usually called <strong>isomerases</strong>,
while those that interconvert the configuration of a chiral carbon are
usually referred to as <strong>racemases</strong> or <strong>epimerases</strong>.</p>
<section id="a-carbonyl-isomerization">
<h3>12.2A: Carbonyl isomerization<a class="headerlink" href="#a-carbonyl-isomerization" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>One very important family of isomerase enzymes catalyzes the shifting of
a carbonyl group in sugar molecules, often converting between a ketose
and an aldose (recall that the terms ketose and aldolse refer to sugar
molecules containing ketone and aldehyde groups, respectively).</p>
<p>Carbonyl isomerization:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2791.png" src="../_images/image2791.png" /></p>
<p>Mechanism:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2801.png" src="../_images/image2801.png" /></p>
<p>fig 8</p>
<p>The ketose species is first converted to its enol tautomer in step 1
(actually, this particular intermediate is known as an
‘<strong>ene-<em>diol</em></strong>*’* rather than an enol, because there are hydroxyl
groups on both sides of the carbon-carbon double bond). Step 2 leads to
the aldose, and is simply another tautomerization step. However, because
there is a hydroxyl group on the adjacent (blue) carbon, a carbonyl can
form there as well as at the red carbon.</p>
<p>An example is the glycolysis pathway reaction catalyzed by the enzyme
triose phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1). Here, dihydroxyacetone
phosphate (DHAP) is reversibly converted to glyceraldehyde phosphate
(GAP).</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2811.png" src="../_images/image2811.png" /></p>
<p>fig 9</p>
<p>Notice that DHAP is achiral while GAP is chiral, and that a new chiral
center is introduced at the middle (red) carbon of GAP. As you should
expect, the enzyme is stereoselective: in step 2 a proton is delivered
to the red carbon, from <em>behind</em> the plane of the page, to yield the <em>R</em>
enantiomer.</p>
<p>Also in the glycolysis pathway, glucose-6-phosphate (an aldose) and
fructose-6-phosphate (a ketose) are interconverted through an ene-diol
intermediate (EC 5.3.1.9) by an enzyme that is closely related to
triose-phosphate isomerase.</p>

<h3>12.2B: Stereoisomerization at the α-carbon<a class="headerlink" href="#b-stereoisomerization-at-the-carbon" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Enolates are a common intermediate in reactions where the stereochemical
configuration of a chiral α-carbon is interconverted. These are commonly
referred to as <strong>racemization</strong> or <strong>epimerization</strong> reactions,
depending on whether the interconverted isomers are enantiomers or
epimers (recall that the term ‘epimer’ refers to a pair of diastereomers
that differ by a single chiral center).</p>
<p>Racemization/epimerization:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2831.png" src="../_images/image2831.png" /></p>
<p>Mechanism:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2841.png" src="../_images/image2841.png" /></p>
<p>fig 11</p>
<p>These reactions proceed though a deprotonation-reprotonation mechanism,
illustrated above. In step 1, the chiral α-carbon is deprotonated,
leading to a planar, achiral enolate. In step 2, a proton is delivered
back to the α-carbon, <em>but from the opposite side from which the proton
was taken in step 1</em>, resulting in the opposite stereochemistry at this
carbon. Two acid-base groups, positioned at opposing sides of the
enzyme’s active site, work in tandem to accomplish this feat.</p>
<p>The proteins and peptides in all known living things are constructed
almost exclusively of L-amino acids, but in rare cases scientists have
identified peptides which incorporate D-amino acids, which have the
opposite stereochemistry at the α-carbon. Amino acid racemase enzymes
catalyze the interconversion of L and D amino acids. As you may recall
from the introductory section to this chapter, the venom of the male
platypus contains a neurotoxic peptide in which an L-leucine amino acid
has been converted by a racemase enzyme to D-leucine. In another
example, the cell walls of bacteria are constructed in part of peptides
containing D-glutamate, converted from L-glutamate by the enzyme
glutamate racemase. (EC 5.1.1.3) (<em>Biochemistry</em> <strong>2001</strong>*,* <em>40</em>,
6199).</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2851.png" src="../_images/image2851.png" /></p>
<p>fig 12</p>
<p>A reaction (EC 5.1.3.1) in sugar metabolism involves the interconversion
of the epimers ribulose-5-phosphate and xylulose-5-phosphate. The enzyme
that catalyzes this reaction is called an ‘epimerase’. (<em>J. Mol. Biol</em>.
<strong>2003</strong>, <em>326</em>, 127).</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2861.png" src="../_images/image2861.png" /></p>
<p>fig 13</p>
<p><u>Exercise 12.2</u>: Draw a reasonable mechanism for the
ribulose-5-phosphate epimerization reaction above. Your mechanism should
show an enolate intermediate and specify stereochemistry throughout.</p>
<p><u>Exercise 12.3</u>: Predict the products of epimerization reactions
starting with each of the substrates shown. Hint - carbons next to imine
groups can also be considered α-carbons!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="../_images/image2871.png" src="../_images/image2871.png" /></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>fig 13</p>
<p>Recall from chapter 3 that a major issue with the drug thalidomide is
the fact that the <em>R</em> enantiomer, which is an effective sedative,
rapidly isomerizes in the body to the terotogenic (mutation-causing) <em>S</em>
enantiomer. Note that the chiral center in thalidomide is an α-carbon!</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2881.png" src="../_images/image2881.png" /></p>
<p>fig 13a</p>
<p>Recently, chemists reported the synthesis of a thalidomide derivative in
which the carbonyl group is replaced by an ‘oxetane’ ring, with the aim
of making an isotopically stable form of the drug (because the carbonyl
group has been removed, racemization is no longer possible - there is no
α-carbon!) (<em>Org. Lett.</em> <strong>2013</strong>, <em>15</em>, 4312.)</p>

<h3>12.2C: Alkene regioisomerization<a class="headerlink" href="#c-alkene-regioisomerization" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The position of an alkene group can also be changed through a reaction
in which the first step is abstraction of an α-proton and formation of
an enolate intermediate. The degradation pathway for unsaturated fatty
acids (fatty acids whose hydrocarbon chains contain one or more double
bonds) involves the ‘shuffling’ of the position of a carbon-carbon
double bond, from a <em>cis</em> bond between carbon #3 and carbon #4 to a
<em>trans</em> bond between carbon #2 and carbon #3<sub>.</sub> This is
accomplished by the enzyme enoyl CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8). (<em>J. Biol

<h2>12.3: Aldol addition reactions<a class="headerlink" href="#aldol-addition-reactions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>We arrive now at one of the most important mechanisms in metabolism: the
aldol addition.</p>
<p>Along with Claisen condensation reactions, which we will study in the
next chapter, aldol additions are responsible for most of the
carbon-carbon bond forming events that occur in a living cell. Because
biomolecules are built upon a framework of carbon-carbon bonds,</p>
<p>it is difficult to overstate the importance of aldol addition and
Claisen condensation reactions in the chemistry of living things!</p>
<section id="a-overview-of-the-aldol-addition-reaction">
<h3>12.3A: Overview of the aldol addition reaction<a class="headerlink" href="#a-overview-of-the-aldol-addition-reaction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider the potential pathways available to a reactive enolate
intermediate once the α-proton has been abstracted. We’ll use
acetaldehyde as a simple example. The oxygen, which bears most of the
negative charge, could act as a base, (step 2 below) and the result
would be an enol.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2921.png" src="../_images/image2921.png" /></p>
<p>fig 15</p>
<p>Alternatively, the enolate carbon, which bears a degree of negative
charge, could act as a base, which is simply the reverse of the initial
deprotonation step that formed the enolate in the first place. This of
course just takes us right back to the starting aldehyde.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2931.png" src="../_images/image2931.png" /></p>
<p>fig 16</p>
<p>In both of these cases, the electron-poor species attacked by the
enolate is an acidic proton. What if the electron-poor species - the
electrophile - is not a proton but a carbonyl carbon? In other words,
what if the enolate acts not as a base but rather as a <em>nucleophile</em> in
a carbonyl addition reaction? For example, the enolate of acetaldehyde
could attack the carbonyl group of a second acetaldehyde molecule. The
result is the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2941.png" src="../_images/image2941.png" /></p>
<p>fig 16a</p>
<p>This type of reaction is called an <strong>aldol addition</strong>. <em>It can be very
helpful to think of an aldol addition reaction as simply a nucleophilic
carbonyl addition (Chapter 10) reaction with an enolate α-carbon (rather
than an alcohol oxygen or amine nitrogen) as the nucleophile.</em></p>
<p>An aldol addition reaction:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2951.png" src="../_images/image2951.png" /></p>
<p>Mechanism:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2961.png" src="../_images/image2961.png" /></p>
<p>fig 17</p>
<p>Historically, the first examples of this mechanism type to be studied
involved reactions very similar to what is shown above: an aldehyde
reacting with itself. Because the resulting product contained both an
<strong>ald</strong>ehyde and an alcoh<strong>ol</strong> functional group, the reaction was
referred to as an ‘aldol’ addition, a terminology that has become
standard for reactions of this type, whether or not an aldehyde is
involved. More generally, an aldol addition is characterized as a
nucleophilic addition to an aldehyde, ketone, or imine electrophile
where the nucleophile is the α-carbon in an aldehyde, ketone, imine,
ester, or thioester. The enzymes that catalyze aldol reactions are
called, not surprisingly, <strong>aldolases</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that the aldol reaction results in a product in which a hydroxide
group is <em>two</em> carbons away from the carbonyl, in the <strong>β position</strong>.
You can think of the β-hydroxy group as a kind of ‘signature’ for an
aldol addition product.</p>
<p>Depending on the starting reactants, <em>nonenzyatic</em> aldol reactions can
take more than one route to form different products. For example, a
reaction between acetaldehyde and 2-butanone could potentially result in
in three different aldol addition products, depending on which of the
three α-carbons (carbons 2, 3, and 5 below) becomes the attacking
nucleophile.</p>

<h3>12.3B: Biochemical aldol addition reactions<a class="headerlink" href="#b-biochemical-aldol-addition-reactions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is an enzyme that
participates in both the glycolytic (sugar catabolism) and
gluconeogenesis (sugar synthesis) biochemical pathways. The reaction
catalyzed by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase links two 3-carbon
sugars, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP, the electrophile in the
reaction) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP, the nucleophile),
forming a 6-carbon product. In the figures below, the nucleophilic and
electrophilic carbons are identified with dots.</p>
<p>The fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase reaction</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image2981.png" src="../_images/image2981.png" /></p>

<p>fig 19</p>
<p>fig 20</p>
<p>In step 1 of the reaction, an α-carbon on DHAP is deprotonated, leading
to an enolate intermediate. In this and many other aldolase reactions, a
zinc cation (Zn<sup>+2</sup>) is positioned in the enzyme’s active site
so as to interact closely with - and stabilize - the negatively charged
oxygen of the enolate intermediate. This is one important way in which
the enzyme lowers the energy barrier to the reaction.</p>
<p>Next, (step 2), the deprotonated α-carbon attacks the carbonyl carbon of
GAP in a nucleophilic addition reaction, leading to the fructose
1,6-bisphosphate product.</p>
<p>Notice that two new chiral centers are created in this reaction. This
reaction, being enzyme-catalyzed, is highly stereoselective due to the
precise position of the two substrates in the active site: only one of
the four possible stereoisomeric products is observed. The enzyme also
exhibits tight control of regiochemistry: GAP and DHAP could potentially
form two other aldol products which are constitutional isomers of
fructose 1,6-bisposphate.</p>

aldehyde carbon of GAP.</p>
<p>b) Draw structures of the two other constitutional isomers that could
<em>hypothetically</em> form in aldol addition reactions between GAP and DHAP.
How many stereoisomers exist for these two alternative products?</p>
<p>Along with aldehydes and ketones, esters and thioesters can also act as
the nucleophilic partners in aldol reactions. In the first step of the
citric acid (Krebs) cycle, acetyl CoA (a thioester nucleophile) adds to
oxaloacetate (a ketone electrophile) (EC 2.3.3.8).</p>
<img alt="../_images/image3001.png" src="../_images/image3001.png" />
<p>fig 22</p>
<p>Notice that the nucleophilic intermediate is an <em>enol</em>, rather than a
zinc-stabilized enolate as was the case with the fructose
1,6-bisphosphate aldolase reaction. An enol intermediate is often
observed when the nucleophilic substrate is a thioester rather than a
ketone or aldehyde.</p>

<h3>12.3C: Going backwards: the retro-aldol cleavage reaction<a class="headerlink" href="#c-going-backwards-the-retro-aldol-cleavage-reaction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Although aldol reactions play a very important role in the formation of
new carbon-carbon bonds in metabolic pathways, it is important to
emphasize that they can also be reversible: in most cases, the energy
level of starting compounds and products are very close. This means
that, depending on metabolic conditions, aldolases can also catalyze
<strong>retro-aldol</strong> reactions: the reverse of aldol reactions, in which
carbon-carbon bonds are <em>broken</em>.</p>
<p>A retro-aldol cleavage reaction:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3011.png" src="../_images/image3011.png" /></p>
<p>Mechanism:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3021.png" src="../_images/image3021.png" /></p>
<p>fig 24</p>
<p>In the retro-aldol cleavage reaction the β-hydroxy group is deprotonated
(step 1 above), to form a carbonyl, at the same time pushing off the
enolate carbon, which is now a leaving group rather than a nucleophile.</p>
<p>Is an enolate a good enough leaving group for this step to be chemically
reasonable? Sure it is: the same stabilizing factors that explain why it
can form as an intermediate in the forward direction (resonance
delocalization of the negative charge to the oxygen, interaction with a
zinc cation) also explain why it is a relatively weak base, and
therefore a relatively good leaving group (remember, weak base = good
leaving group!). All we need to do to finish the reaction off is
reprotonate the enolate (step 2) to yield the starting aldehyde, and we
are back where we started.</p>
<p>The key thing to keep in mind when looking at a retro-aldol mechanism is
that, when the carbon-carbon bond breaks, the electrons must have ‘some
place to go’ where they will be stabilized by resonance. <em>Most often,
the substrate for a retro-aldol reaction is a β-hydroxy aldehyde,
ketone, ester, or thioester</em>.</p>
<p>If the leaving electrons cannot be stabilized, a retro-aldol cleavage
step is highly unlikely.</p>

<p>fig 26a</p>
<p>The fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase reaction we saw in the previous
section is an excellent example of an enzyme whose metabolic role is to
catalyze both the forward and reverse (retro) directions of an aldol
reaction. The same enzyme participates both as an aldolase in the
sugar-building gluconeogenesis pathway, and as a retro-aldolase in the
sugar breaking glycolysis pathway. We have already seen it in action as
an aldolase in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Here it is in the glycolytic
direction, catalyzing the retro-aldol cleavage of fructose bisphosphate
into DHAP and GAP:</p>

<h3>12.3D: Aldol addition reactions with enzyme-linked enamine intermediates<a class="headerlink" href="#d-aldol-addition-reactions-with-enzyme-linked-enamine-intermediates" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Earlier we looked at the mechanism for the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
aldolase reaction in bacteria. Interestingly, it appears that the enzyme
catalyzing the exact same reaction in plants and animals evolved
differently: instead of going through a zinc-stabilized enolate
intermediate, in plants and animals the key intermediate is an
<em>enamine</em>. The nucleophilic substrate is first linked to the enzyme
through the formation of an iminium with a lysine residue in the
enzyme’s active site (refer to section 10.5 for the mechanism of iminium
formation). <em>This effectively forms an ‘electron sink’, in which the
positively-charged iminium nitrogen plays the same role as the
Zn<sup>+2</sup> ion in the bacterial enzyme.</em></p>
<p>Mechanism for an aldol addition reaction with an enzyme-linked enamine
intermediate</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3071.png" src="../_images/image3071.png" /></p>
<p>fig 28</p>
<p>The α-proton, made more acidic by the electron-withdrawing effect of the
imminium nitrogen, is then abstracted by an active site base to form an
enamine (step 1). In step 2 , the α-carbon attacks the carbonyl carbon
of an aldehyde, and the new carbon-carbon bond is formed. In order to
release the product from the enzyme active site and free the enzyme to
catalyze another reaction, the iminium is hydrolyzed back to a ketone
group (see section 10.5 to review the imine/imminium hydrolysis
mechanism).</p>
<p>There are many more examples of aldol/retroaldol reactions in which the
key intermediate is a lysine-linked imine. Many bacteria are able to
incorporate formaldehyde, a toxic compound, into carbohydrate metabolism
by linking it to ribulose monophosphate. The reaction (EC 4.1.2.43)
proceeds through imine and enamine intermediates.</p>

<h2>4: ⍺-carbon reactions in the synthesis lab - kinetic vs. thermodynamic enolates<a class="headerlink" href="#carbon-reactions-in-the-synthesis-lab-kinetic-vs-thermodynamic-enolates" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>While aldol addition reactions are widespread in biochemical pathways as
a way of forming carbon-carbon bonds, synthetic organic chemists working
the lab also make use of aldol-like reactions for the same purpose.
Consider this reaction:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3101.png" src="../_images/image3101.png" /></p>
<p>fig 30b</p>
<p>Here, cyclopentanone is deprotonated at an α-carbon by lithium
diisopropylamide (LDA), a very strong base commonly used in the
synthesis lab. Addition to the reaction mixture of an electrophile in
the form of a primary alkyl bromide results in formation of a new
carbon-carbon bond. Notice that this is a kind of ‘S<sub>N</sub>2
variation’ on the aldol addition reactions we saw above, because the
enolate nucleophile is attacking in S<sub>N</sub>2 fashion rather than
in a carbonyl addition fashion.</p>
<p>What would happen, though, if we started with 2-ethylcyclopentantone?
Because the starting ketone is no longer symmetrical, we could
hypothetically obtain two different products:</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3111.png" src="../_images/image3111.png" /></p>
<p>fig 30c</p>
<p>It turns out that we can control which product we get by selecting the
base used in the reaction, and the reaction temperature. If we use LDA
and immerse the reaction flask in a dry ice-acetone bath (-78
<sup>o</sup>C), we get mainly 2,5-diethyl cyclopentanone. If we use
potassium hydride (KH) and run the reaction at room temperature, we get
mainly 2,2-diethylcyclopentanone.</p>
<p>LDA is a very <em>hindered</em> base: the basic nitrogen atom is surrounded by
two bulky isopropyl groups, and thus it is more difficult for it to come
into contact with an α-proton. The α-protons on the <em>less substituted</em>
side of 2-ethylcyclopentanone are less hindered and more accessible to
the base. In addition, the cold reaction temperature means that the
deprotonation step is <em>irreversible</em>: the system does not have enough
energy to overcome the energy barrier for the reverse (reprotonation)
reaction. The less substituted enolate forms faster, and once it forms
it goes on to attack the bromoethane rather then reversing back to the
ketone form. Because it is the <em>rate</em> of enolate formation that
determines the major product under these conditions, we say that this
reaction is under <strong>kinetic control</strong>, and the less substituted enolate
intermediate is called the <strong>kinetic enolate</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/image3121.png" src="../_images/image3121.png" /></p>
<p>fig 30d</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we use KH as a base, hindrance is no longer an
issue because the base is a hydride ion. We run this reaction at room
temperature, so the system has enough energy to overcome the energy
barrier for re-protonation, and enolate formation is reversible. The
enolate in most abundance at equilibrium is therefore not the one that
forms fastest, but the one that is <em>more stable</em>. The <em>more substituted</em>
enolate is more stable (recall that alkenes are more stable when they
are more substituted - the same idea applies here). The more substituted
enolate leads to the 2,2-diethyl cyclopentanone product. Because it is
the <em>stability</em> of the enolate intermediate that determines the major
product under these conditions, we say that this reaction is under
<strong>thermodynamic control</strong>, and the more substituted enolate intermediate
is the <strong>thermodynamic enolate</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>P12.4:</strong> Below is a step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. Draw a

<p><strong>P12.6:</strong> Sugar-interconverting transaldol reactions play an important

site. Then, in a forward aldol step, a second aldose (e.g.
erythrose-4-phosphate) enters the active site and connects to what
remains from the original ketose (the red part in the figure below) to
form a new ketose (e.g. sedoheptulose-7-phosphate). Transaldolase
enzymes generally have a lysine in the active site that is covalently
bound to the substrate throughout the reaction cycle.</p>
