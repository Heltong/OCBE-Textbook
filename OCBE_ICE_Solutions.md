# 1

**E1.1:**

a\) The atomic number of P (phosphorus) is 15, meaning there are 15
protons. The mass number for the <sup>31</sup>P isotope is 31, so:

15 protons + **16 neutrons** = mass number 31

(recall that mass number is number of protons and neutrons).

*(for parts b-d, use the same reasoning as above)*

b\) 15 protons + **17 neutrons** = mass number 32

c\) 17 protons + **20 neutrons** = mass number 37

d\) 1 proton + **2 neutrons** = mass number 3

e\) 6 protons + **8 neutrons** = mass number 14

hydrogens:

**E1.8:**

<img src="media/image8.emf" style="width:2.30556in;height:1.79653in" />

**E1.10:** There is only one constitutional isomer of ethanol: dimethyl
ether CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>

**E1.11:**

a\)

<img src="media/image9.emf" style="width:2.63889in;height:0.44444in" />

**E1.12:**

a\) carboxylate, sulfide, aromatic, two amide groups (one of which is
cyclic)

b\) tertiary alcohol, thioester

c\) carboxylate, ketone

d\) ether, primary amine, alkene

**E1.14:**

acetic acid: ethanoic acid

chloroform: trichloromethane

acetone: propanone (not 2-propanone, because the '2' in this case would
be redundant: if the carbonyl carbon were not in the \#2 position, the
compound would be an aldehyde not a ketone)

**E1.17:** The linking group is a phosphate diester

# 2 

**E2.1**:

<img src="media/image12.emf" style="width:3.50903in;height:0.63889in" />

**E2.2**: *sp*<sup>3</sup> orbital on carbon overlapping with *3p*
orbital on chlorine.

**E2.3:** Both the carbon and the nitrogen atom in
CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> are *s*p<sup>3</sup>-hybridized. The C-N σ
bond is an overlap between two *s*p<sup>3</sup> orbitals.

<img src="media/image13.emf" style="width:3.86111in;height:1.65764in" />

**E2.4:** Atoms in red all lie in the same plane.

<img src="media/image14.emf" style="width:2.93056in;height:0.72222in" />

**E2.5:** The carbon atoms in an aromatic ring are sp2 hybridized, thus
bonding geometry is trigonal planar: in other words, the bonds coming
out of the ring are in the same plane as the ring, *not* pointing above
the plane of the ring as the wedges in the incorrect drawing indicate. A
correct drawing should use lines to indicate that the bonds are in the
same plane as the ring:

<img src="media/image15.emf" style="width:4.54167in;height:0.95833in" />

**E2.6:**

a\) The carbon and nitrogen atoms are both *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybridized.
The carbon-nitrogen double bond is composed of a σ bond formed from two
*sp*<sup>2</sup> orbitals, and a π bond formed from the side-by-side
overlap of two unhybridized *2p* orbitals.

<img src="media/image16.emf" style="width:1.37986in;height:0.75in" />

b\) As shown in the figure above, the nitrogen lone pair electrons
occupy one of the three *sp2* hybrid orbitals.

bond e: lone pair on N occupies an *sp*<sup>3</sup> orbital

**E2.9:**

<img src="media/image18.emf" style="width:4.29167in;height:1.40278in" />

**E2.10:** The conjugated system contains 22 2*p* orbitals sharing 22 π
electrons

<img src="media/image19.emf" style="width:6in;height:1.20779in" />

**E2.11:**

Indole: nitrogen is 'pyrrole-like' (lone pair is part of aromatic ring)

Purine: N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>3</sub>, and N<sub>7</sub> are
pyridine-like (lone pair in *sp*<sup>2</sup> orbital); N<sub>9</sub> is
'pyrrole-like'.

**

**E2.16:**

<img src="media/image26.emf" style="width:5.88889in;height:1.32431in" />

Left: an H atom has been added - in resonance contributors, only π
electrons and lone pairs are rearranged.

Right: Following the curved arrow, the oxygen atom should have only 6
electrons and thus a positive formal charge. Also the nitrogen is
breaking the octet rule (remember that drawing lone pairs is optional,
so even if they are not drawn you need to assume they are there)

<img src="media/image27.emf" style="width:5.57431in;height:1.29653in" />

Left: The CH<sub>3</sub> carbon is breaking the octet rule with 5 bonds.

Right: One carbon would have a positive formal charge if the arrows are
followed, and the other breaks the octet rule with 5 bonds (keep careful
track of hydrogen atoms when they are not drawn in line structures!)

<img src="media/image28.emf" style="width:5.13889in;height:1.37986in" />

Left: One oxygen should have a positive formal charge, and one breaks
the octet rule.

Right: a) the arrow shows this single bond breaking - you can't break
single bonds in a resonance contributor. b) the arrow shows a triple
bond forming here, which would also mean the oxygen is breaking the
octet rule.

**  
**

**E2.17:**

a\)

<img src="media/image29.emf" style="width:1.88889in;height:0.55556in" />

The contributor on the left is minor because it a) has a separation of
charges, and b) the carbon has an incomplete octet.

b\) Acetone and 2-propanol have the same molecular formula but different
atom-to-atom bonding arrangements. Therefore, they are constitutional
isomers, *not* resonance contributors.

**E2.18:**

a\) Minor contributors have additional separation of charge.

<img src="media/image30.emf" style="width:5.33333in;height:3.17569in" />

b\)

<img src="media/image31.emf" style="width:4.12986in;height:3.43542in" />

**E2.19:**

<img src="media/image32.emf" style="width:4.10208in;height:0.68542in" />

The contributor on the left is the most stable: there are no formal
charges.

The contributor on the right is least stable: there are formal charges,
and a carbon has an incomplete octet.

The contributor in the middle is intermediate stability: there are
formal charges, but all atoms have a complete octet.

**E2.20:** Consult your instructor or tutor for an evaluation of your
orbital drawings. Both contributors should show three overlapping *p*
orbitals (on the oxygen, carbonyl carbon, and nitrogen) sharing four π
electrons.

**E2.21:** Consult your instructor or tutor for an evaluation of your
orbital drawings. Both contributors should show three overlapping *p*
orbitals sharing four π electrons.

**  
**

**E2.22:**

<img src="media/image33.emf" style="width:0.91667in;height:0.66667in" />

This contributor is major because there are no formal charges.

**E2.23:**

> fig 3

b\) The conjugated π system in this carbocation is composed of
**<u>seven</u>** *p* orbitals containing **<u>six</u>** delocalized π
electrons.

**E2.24:**

>

> c\) The conjugated π system in structure a) is composed of **seven** p
> orbitals containing **eight** delocalized π electrons.

**E2.25**: The two major contributors or those in which the negative
formal charge is located on an oxygen rather than on a carbon.

<img src="media/image37.emf" style="width:4.40764in;height:0.66667in" />

**E2.26:**

The <u>horizontal trend</u> is based on atomic number (the number of
protons in the nucleus). For example, fluorine is more electronegative
than carbon, because the fluorine nucleus contains three more protons,
the positive charges on which pull negatively-charged electrons closer
to the nucleus.

The <u>vertical trend</u> is based on atom size, specifically the size
of the 'electron cloud' surrounding the nucleus. For example, fluorine
is more electronegative than chlorine (even though chlorine contains
more protons) because the outermost valence electrons on fluorine, which
are in the n = 2 "shell", are closer to the nucleus than the valence
electrons in chlorine, which occupy the *n* = 3 "shell". The fluorine
electron cloud, therefore, is subject to greater electrostatic
attractive forces from protons (electrostatic forces decrease rapidly as
the distance between the positive and negative charges increases.)

**E2.27**: Only molecule (b) does *not* have a molecular dipole, due to
its symmetry (bond dipoles are equal and in opposite directions).

**E2.28**: To be a hydrogen bond donor, the molecule needs to have a
hydrogen bound to N, O, or F. To be an acceptor, it merely needs an N,
O, or F.

<img src="media/image38.emf" style="width:5.22222in;height:2.24097in" />

**E2.29:** Note in part (c) that methyl acetate can only be a hydrogen
bond acceptor, *not* a donor.

<img src="media/image39.emf" style="width:3.74097in;height:3.12986in" />

**E2.30:** The main factors in these examples are the number of
H-bonding groups, whether groups are H-bond acceptors *and* donors or
just acceptors, and the number of carbons.

<img src="media/image40.emf" style="width:6in;height:3.46876in" />

**E2.31:** Ascorbic acid and niacin are water soluble (lots of
hydrophilic groups relative to the number of carbons). Retinol is
fat-soluble (only one hydrophilic alcohol group, a large hydrophobic
hydrocarbon group.

**E2.32:** Aniline is basic and would be protonated (and thus cationic)
in aqueous HCl. Charged species are generally water soluble. On the
other hand, phenol is not basic and thus would remain as a neutral,
water-insoluble molecule.

**E2.33:** Both alcohol solvents could form H-bonds with cyclohexanone,
but isopropanol is less polar (it has three carbons), and thus would be
the better solvent for the relatively nonpolar cyclohexanone.

**E2.34:** Benzene has no polar groups and thus has the lowest boiling
point (nonpolar interactions only holding molecules together).
Benzaldehyde can form intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions; phenol
and benzaldehyde can both form intermolecular H-bonds, but benzaldehyde
has more dipole-dipole interactions due to the additional oxygen atom.

<img src="media/image41.emf" style="width:4.52778in;height:1.11111in" />

**E2.35:** Hexane has the higher melting point. Both compounds have an
equal number of carbons and hydrogens and are nonpolar, so it comes down
to shape. 2-3-dimethylbutane is more sphere-like and is capable of less
efficient molecule-to-molecule packing, so it has weaker intermolecular
interactions and thus a lower melting point.

**E3.1**:

<img src="media/image42.emf" style="width:3.1in;height:2.92222in" />

**E3.2:**

<img src="media/image43.emf" style="width:2.38889in;height:1.1in" />

**E3.3:** Recall from your General Chemistry course that ∆G<sup>0</sup>,
the standard Gibbs Free Energy change of a reaction (or in this case, a
conformational change) is related to the equilibrium constant
K<sub>eq</sub> by:

∆G<sup>0</sup> = RTlnK<sub>eq</sub> *or* K<sub>eq</sub> =
e^(-∆G<sup>0</sup>/RT)

where R is the gas constant 8.314 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>

Using T = 298K (25<sup>o</sup>C) and ∆G<sup>0</sup> = -7.0 kJ/mol, we
calculate **K<sub>eq</sub> = 17**.

Note that ∆G<sup>0</sup> has a negative value because the methyl-axial
to methyl-equatorial ring flip is an energetically downhill process.
Because the equatorial conformation is more stable, it makes sense that
the equilibrium constant for the ring flip is greater than 1.

**E3.4:** Note in (b) that one of the substituents *must* be in the
axial position. In the lower energy chair conformation, it is the
*smaller* methyl group that assumes the axial position.

<img src="media/image44.emf" style="width:4.97778in;height:1.04444in" />

**E3.5:** To answer these questions, you will want to draw out the chair
conformations of the compounds specified.

a\) ***cis*-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane**: the two methyl groups are either
both equatorial or both axial. In *cis*-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane, one
methyl group is always axial and one equatorial, so the two
conformations have the same energy.

b\) ***trans*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**: the two methyl groups are
either both equatorial or both axial. In *cis*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane,
one methyl group is always axial and one equatorial, so the two
conformations have the same energy.

c\) ***trans*-1-isopropyl-2-methylcyclohexane**: both compounds are
either diaxial or diequatorial, but the larger isopropyl substituent
means that the difference between the diaxial and diequatorial
conformations is larger.

**E3.6:** No. In order to change the relationship of two substituents on
a ring from *cis* to *trans*, you would need to break and reform two
covalent bonds. Ring flips involve only *rotation* of single bonds

**E3.7:**

<img src="media/image45.emf" style="width:4.23611in;height:1.55556in" />

**E3.8**: Chiral centers are designated with a dot.

<img src="media/image46.emf" style="width:5.77778in;height:2.68542in" />

**E3.9**: (there are other ways that the two enantiomers can be drawn
correctly - check your drawing with your instructor or tutor)

a\)

<img src="media/image47.emf" style="width:3.55556in;height:2.37986in" />

b\) No, the two structures are identical. In both drawings, the bond to
the OH is pointing *out of the plane of the page* - it doesn't matter
whether the solid wedge is pointing to the left or the right. Make
models of the two drawings and you will see they are exactly the same.

**  
**

**E3.10**:

<img src="media/image48.emf" style="width:5.32431in;height:3.32431in" />

**E3.11**:

<img src="media/image49.emf" style="width:4.60208in;height:1.43542in" />

**E3.12**: The C-O bond should be drawn as a dash to get the *R*
configuration.

**E3.13**:

<img src="media/image50.emf" style="width:6in;height:1.27752in" />

**E3.14**: The value of *c* is 7.50 g/100 mL, so using the definition of
specific rotation, the observed rotation is expected to be (11.5)(7.5) =
86.3<sup>o</sup>.

**E3.15**: The observed rotation of the mixture is levorotary (negative,
counter-clockwise), and the specific rotation of the pure *R* enantiomer
is given as dextrorotary (positive, clockwise), meaning that the pure
*S* enantiomer must be levorotary, and the mixture must contain more of
the *S* enantiomer than of the *R* enantiomer.

**E3.16**: Cysteine is the only common L-amino acid with *S*
configuration. This is solely due to the rules of the naming system: the
carbon of the side chain - which is directly bonded to a sulfur - has
higher priority than the carboxylate carbon. In the other 19 amino
acids, the carboxylate carbon has priority \#2, and the side chain
carbon has priority \#3.

**E3.17**:

a\) Starting with the RRR stereoisomer (which is given in the example),
we flip the first and third chiral center to get SRS. The enantiomer of
the SRS stereoisomer is that in which all three chiral centers are
flipped: the RSR stereoismer.

<img src="media/image51.emf" style="width:6in;height:1.47273in" />

b\) Epimers of the SRS stereoismer are RRS, SSS, and SRR (in each case,
one of the three chiral centers has been flipped)

c\) How to find the compounds that are diastereomers of the SRS
stereoisomer, but not epimers? Start with the list of the eight possible
stereoisomers given in the example. Cross out SRS itself, and its
enantiomer RSR (determined in part (a) above). Then cross out the three
epimers we found in part (b). We are left with three isomers: RRR, SSR,
and RSS. Each of these have one chiral center in common with SRS, and
two that are flipped.

**RRR** ~~RRS~~ ~~RSR~~ **RSS**

~~SSS~~ **SSR** ~~SRS~~ ~~SRR~~

**E3.18**: This is the SRR stereoisomer.

<img src="media/image52.emf" style="width:1.27778in;height:0.87986in" />

**E3.19**:

<img src="media/image53.emf" style="width:1.93542in;height:0.79653in" />

**E3.20**:

<img src="media/image54.emf" style="width:5.08333in;height:1.32431in" />

**E3.21**: Going left to right, top to bottom:

Diastereomers (two chiral centers are flipped).

Enantiomers (all five chiral centers are flipped).

Identical (drawing is flipped vertically but they are the same
structure).

Identical (the carbon which appears to be flipped in the drawing is
*not* a chiral center).

Constitutional isomers (same molecular formula, but notice that inositol
does not have a ring oxygen. Is not a monosaccharide, it is a
cyclohexane with six hydroxyl substituents.)

**E3.22**:

a\) Identical. They have the same molecular formula and connectivity;
there is only one chiral center, which is *R* in both structures.

b\) Enantiomers. The compound on the left is *R*, compound on the right
is *S*.

c\) Enantiomers. The compound on the left is *R*, compound on the right
is *S*.

d\) Enantiomers. The compound on the left is *SS*, compound on the right
is *RR*.

e\) Identical. The structures are both glycerol, which is *not* chiral
(the left and right 'arms' are the same, so the middle carbon is not a
chiral center)

f\) Identical. Both structures are *SS*. Also, notice that if you rotate
the right-side structure 120 degrees clockwise, it becomes exactly the
same as the left-side structure.

**E3.23**:

a\) Not *meso* b) *Meso*. c) Not meso

d\) *Meso* e) Not *meso* f) *Meso*

**E3.24**:

<img src="media/image55.emf" style="width:5.60208in;height:4.66667in" />

**E3.25**:

a\) *E* b) *N* c) *Z* d) *E*

**  
**

**E3.26**:

<img src="media/image56.emf" style="width:4.54653in;height:3.58333in" />

**E3.27:** The enantiomers of the compounds shown are below. Note that
the chiral centers are flipped, but the stereogenic alkenes are not.

<img src="media/image57.emf" style="width:4.16667in;height:1.35208in" />

**E3.28**:

Ephedrine and pseudoephedrin are diastereomers (epimers). There are two
chiral centers, and one of them (the OH) is flipped.

Methamphetamine and *levo*-methamphetamine are enantiomers (only one
chiral center, and it is flipped). Methamphetamine technically should be
called *dextro*-methamphetamine.

**  
**

**E3.29**:

<img src="media/image58.emf" style="width:3.83333in;height:2.88889in" />

**E3.30**:

<img src="media/image59.emf" style="width:2.04653in;height:2.11111in" />

**E3.31:**

<img src="media/image60.emf" style="width:1.41667in;height:0.66667in" />

# 4

**E4.1**:

a\) You would expect to see fragments of *m/z* = 15, 29, 43, 57, and 72.

<img src="media/image61.emf" style="width:3.21319in;height:1.80556in" />

b\) You would expect to see fragments of *m/z* = 29, 43 (cations); 57,
71 (acylium ions), and 102 (molecular ion).

c\) All of the fragmentation events shown in the example would lead to
fragments with *m/z* = 84.

<img src="media/image62.emf" style="width:3.65764in;height:1.18542in" />

**E4.2**: Chlorine has two main isotopes of mass 35 (abundance \~76%)
and 37 (abundance \~24%). Therefore, fragments containing Cl would be
seen in pairs with relative heights of about 3:1.

<img src="media/image63.emf" style="width:4.35208in;height:1.10208in" />

**E4.3**: The mass spectrum fits that of propanal. The most abundant
fragment (the base peak) is the acylium ion containing the aldehyde
hydrogen.

<img src="media/image64.emf" style="width:1.77778in;height:0.83333in" />

**E4.4**:

Using λν = *c*, we first rearrange to ν = *c*/λ to solve for frequency.

For light with a wavelength of 400 nm, the frequency is 7.50 x
10<sup>14</sup> Hz:

<img src="media/image65.emf" style="width:2.54653in;height:0.46319in" />

In the same way, we calculate that light with a wavelength of 700 nm has
a frequency of 4.29 x 10<sup>14</sup> Hz.

To calculate corresponding energies:

Using E = *h*ν, we find for light at 400 nm:

E = (6.626 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J<sup>.</sup>s) (7.50 x 10<sup>14</sup>
s<sup>-1</sup>)

4.97 x 10<sup>-19</sup> J per photon, or 299 kJ per mole of photons if
we multiply by Avagadro's number.

Using the same process, we find that light at 700 nm corresponds to 171
kJ per mole of photons.

**E4.5**:

A wavenumber of 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup> means that 3000 waves fit in one cm
(0.01m):

<img src="media/image66.emf" style="width:0.83333in;height:0.38889in" />

We want to find the length of 1 wave, so we divide numerator and
denominator by 3000:

<img src="media/image67.emf" style="width:2.09236in;height:0.42569in" />

So 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup> is equivalent to a wavelength of 3.33 μm.

**E4.6**:

<img src="media/image68.emf" style="width:6in;height:1.008in" />

We can distinguish the alkenes from the alkenes by their respective C-C
stretching bands. To distinguish between the two alkenes, we recognize
that1,3-octadiene will have characteristic vinylic C-H stretching bands,
whereas 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene will not. In a similar argument,
1-octyne will show a terminal alkyne C-H stretching band, while 3-octyne
will not.

**E4.7**: Using the online Spectral Database for Organic Compounds, look
up IR spectra for the following compounds, and identify absorbance bands
corresponding to those listed in the table above. List actual
frequencies for each signal to the nearest cm<sup>-1</sup> unit, using
the information in tables provided on the site.

a\) 1-methylcyclohexanol: O-H stretching centered at 3375
cm<sup>-1</sup>

b\) 4-methylcyclohexene: alkene C-H stretching at 3025 cm<sup>-1</sup>;
alkene C-C stretching at 1651 cm<sup>-1</sup>

c\) 1-hexyne: terminal alkyne C-H stretching at 3311cm-1, alkyne C-C
stretching at 2120 cm<sup>-1</sup>.

d\) 2-hexyne: alkyne C-C stretching at 2054 cm<sup>-1</sup> (this signal
is *very* weak, because the molecule is near-symmetrical and thus the
triple bond has only a very weak dipole moment)

e\) 3-hexyne-2,5-diol: O-H stretching centered on 2983. No alkyne C-C
stretching band because the molecule is symmetrical.

**E4.8**: As carbon-carbon bonds get shorter and stronger moving from
single to double to triple order, the stretching frequency becomes
higher, meaning shorter wavelengths (higher wavenumbers) . Imagine two
balls connected by a short, tight spring compared to the same two balls
connected to a longer, looser spring. If you compress and release both
springs so that the balls bounce back and forth, the shorter spring will
bounce more rapidly (higher frequency).

**E4.9**: Using the same method as in Exercise 4.4, we find that photons
of light with wavelength of 470 nm have energy of 255 kJ/mol.

**E4.10**: Molecule A has a longer system of conjugated π bonds, and
thus will absorb at a longer wavelength. Notice that there is an
sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized carbon in molecule B which isolates two of the
π bonds from the other three.

<img src="media/image69.emf" style="width:2.88819in;height:1.17778in" />

**E4.11**: We use the formula:

<img src="media/image70.emf" style="width:1.47222in;height:0.57431in" />

recall from your high school algebra that if y = log(x), then x =
10<sup>y</sup> , so:

<img src="media/image71.emf" style="width:1.32431in;height:0.42569in" />

. . . so the intensity of light entering the sample (I<sub>0</sub>) is
10 times the intensity of the light (at a particular wavelength) that
emerges from the sample and is detected (I). Because %T is simply the
reciprocal of this ratio multiplied by 100, we find that A = 1.0
corresponds to 10% transmission.

**E4.12**: Using ε = A/c, we plug in our values for ε and A and find
that c = 16.3 ng/uL for the diluted sample. The original sample was 20
times more concentrated (remember that we diluted 50 uL of it into a
total volume of 1000 uL), so the concentration of the original sample
was 326 ng/uL, or 0.326 ug/uL.

# 5

**E5.1**: The energy gaps of the magnetic transitions in observed in NMR
are *much* smaller than those of the vibrational transitions observed in
IR spectroscopy. In NMR we are looking at absorbance of radiation in
radio frequency ranges - radio waves are in the order of several meters
long, compared to micrometers for infrared light. Remember that longer
wavelengths have lower associated energy.

**E5.2**: Going left to right, top to bottom, the number of 'sets' of
protons are:

3, 3 3, 2

8, 8, 6\*

\*The two terminal alkene protons are diastereotopic and thus
non-equivalent.

**E5.3**:

a\) 1 ppm of 500 MHz is 500 Hz. Thus chemical shifts of 2.0 and 3.6 ppm
corresponds to 1000 Hz and 1800 Hz, respectively.

b\) The actual resonance frequencies are the above chemical shifts
*added to* 500 million Hz. Thus, they are 500,001,000 Hz and 500,001,800
Hz.

**E5.4**: The acetone:dichloromethane ratio is 0.76 to 1. If it was a
1:1 ratio, the signal integration ratio would be 3:1 because acetone has
6 protons while dichloromethane has 2. So you need to divide the 2.3
integral value by a factor of 3 to get 0.76.

**E5.5**: There are three peaks: two from *para*-xylene and one from
acetone. The acetone peak and the *para*-xylene methyl peak both
represent six protons, so the ratio of their integration values is
simply 64 to 36 or 1 to 0.56. The ratio of the *para*-xylene methyl peak
to the *para*-xylene aromatic peak is 6 to 4, or 0.56 to 0.37. So the
final integral ratio of acetone:methyl:aromatic signals should be 1 to
0.56 to 0.37.

**E5.6**:

a\) H<sub>a</sub> is higher - closer to carbonyl

b\) H<sub>b</sub> is higher - adjacent to *two* carbonyl groups

c\) H<sub>a</sub> is higher. Consult Table 2: Amide protons
(H<sub>a</sub>) are 5-9 ppm, while ether protons (H<sub>b</sub>) are
3.7 - 3.9 ppm.

d\) H<sub>a</sub> is most likely higher. Aromatic protons
(H<sub>a</sub>) are 6.0 - 8.7 ppm, while vinylic protons (H<sub>b</sub>)
are 3.7 - 6.5 ppm)

e\) H<sub>a</sub> is higher

f\) H<sub>b</sub> is higher - aldehyde protons are 9.5 - 10 ppm

g\) H<sub>b</sub> is higher - both are adjacent to carboxylate, but
H<sub>b</sub> is also adjacent to OH.

**E5.7**: The molecule contains two groups of equivalent protons: the
twelve pointing to the outside of the ring, and the six pointing into
the center of the ring. The molecule is aromatic, as evidenced by the
chemical shift of the ‘outside’ protons’ (and the fact that there are 18
π electrons, a Hückel number). The inside protons are *shielded* by the
induced field of the aromatic ring current, because *inside the ring
this field points in the opposite direction of B<sub>0</sub>*. This is
the source of the unusually low (negative relative to TMS) chemical
shift for these protons.

**E5.8**:

a\)

<img src="media/image72.emf" style="width:1.52778in;height:1.55556in" />

b\) The figure above demonstrates that the quartet subpeaks integrate to
1:3:3:1 (eg., there are three ways for two spins to be aligned with
B<sub>0</sub> and one against B<sub>0</sub>). As an analogy, if you flip
three coins at once, you have a 1 in eight chance of getting all heads,
1 in 8 chance of all tails, a 3 in 8 chance of two heads and a tail, and
a 3 in 8 chance of two tails and a head.

**E5.9**:

Because of the symmetry in the molecule, there are only four proton
signals. Predicted splitting is indicated.

<img src="media/image73.emf" style="width:1.92569in;height:1.52778in" />

**E5.10**: We would expect to see nine signals, although signals may
overlap in an actual spectrum. Remember that protons bound to
heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur) generally do not couple to
adjacent protons, and give broad peaks.

<img src="media/image74.emf" style="width:1.86667in;height:1.55556in" />

**E5.13**:

a\) 4-heptanone (there are only three proton signals due to symmetry):

<img src="media/image76.emf" style="width:1.31806in;height:0.60764in" />

b\) cyclopentanone

c\) butaldehyde (aldehyde protons are in the 9.5-10 ppm range.

**E5.14**: Each spectrum will have two in the range for vinylic protons,
in each case both of these signals will be doublets. In the spectrum for
compound A, the coupling constant will be in the 12-18 Hz range
(*trans*), in compound B it will be in the 6-12 Hz range (*cis*), and in
compound C it will be in the 0-2 Hz range (*gem*).

toluene (methylbenzene). The chemical shifts of all carbons are
indicated below, based on the spectra provided.

**E5.18**:

<img src="media/image78.emf" style="width:4.30833in;height:3.71042in" />

**E5.19**:

a\) Check your structures with your instructor or tutor.

b\) In this case, n = 3 and A = 8+0-1-1 = 6

so IHD = (8-6)/2 = 1

This makes sense as there is only one double bond in alanine.

c\)

ascorbic acid: one ring and two double bonds, so IHD = 3

thiamine: two rings and five double bonds, so IHD = 7

**E5.21**: The 'center of mass' of the doublet of doublets is 1863 Hz.
The large coupling is 17.4 Hz, so first we subtract half of 17.4, or
8.7, from 1863 to get 1854.3 Hz. To find the frequency of the most
upfield peak, we subtract half of the small coupling (1.5 divided by 2)
to get 1854.3 - 0.75 = **1853.6 Hz**

**E5.23**: The two signals can be differentiated simply by determining
the 'large' coupling constant for each: 10.5 Hz for the *cis* coupling
between H<sub>a</sub> and H<sub>b</sub>, and 17.4 Hz for *trans*
coupling between H<sub>a</sub> and H<sub>c</sub>.

**E5.24**:

<img src="media/image82.emf" style="width:1.65417in;height:2.31806in" />

**E5.25**: If you draw such a signal to approximate scale, you see that
it is a doublet of triplets: the subpeaks at 1586, 1583, and 1580 Hz
make up the upfield triplet, the other three the downfield triplet. The
fine splitting is 3 Hz (note that 1586-1583 = 3, or 1569-1566 = 3,
etc.). To find the recorded chemical shift, simply take the average of
all six subpeaks (or simply the average of the two middle subpeaks, 1583
Hz and 1569 Hz): you find this is 1576 Hz.

<u>Exercise 6.5</u>: Imagine that you are trying to extinguish a burning
campfire using buckets of water filled from a faucet some distance from
the fire. It takes 20 seconds to fill a bucket at the faucet, and two
seconds to carry the bucket to the fire and dump it on the flames. You
have plenty of people to carry the buckets, but only one faucet so you
can only fill one at a time.

a\) If you double the speed at which you carry the buckets by running
instead of walking, what effect will this have on how fast you get water
to the fire?

b\) If, instead, you realize you can double the speed at which you fill
up the buckets by opening the faucet a couple of turns, by what percent
will you speed up the entire process?

c\) What is the rate-determining step for the process?

**E6.5**:

a\) No change. The water carriers will each be waiting a little longer
to get a bucket to carry, but water will not be delivered any faster.

b\) Your rate will double.

c\) Filling buckets is the rate determining step of the process. This of
course is an analogy for a two step chemical reaction, with one slow
(rate-determining) step, and one fast step.

**E6.6**:

a\) Endergonic (D is higher in energy than A)

b\) Three steps

c\) Two intermediates (B and C)

d, e)

<img src="media/image89.emf" style="width:3.45833in;height:2.02127in" />

f\) C to B in the reverse direction (activation energy from C to middle
transition state is lowest of the six possible activation energies).

**E6.7**: While the oxidation of sugar and fat is *thermodynamically*
downhill (exergonic), in terms of *kinetics* it is very slow - without a
catalyst, oxidation will not occur at an appreciable time frame. In
other words, the energy barrier to oxidation is high. When we 'burn'
(oxidize) sugar and fat in our cells, the process is vastly accelerated
by enzymes (specifically the enzymes of glycolysis, fatty acid
oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation - we
will see many of the individual enzymatic reactions later in this
textbook, and you will see how these pathways fit together when you
study biochemistry).

**E7.1**:

<img src="media/image90.emf" style="width:3.51875in;height:2.51875in" />

**E7.2**:Remember that the stronger conjugate acid has the weaker
conjugate base.  From the table of approximate pK<sub>a</sub> values
given in this section, CH<sub>3</sub>SH (pK<sub>a</sub> \~ 10) is a
stronger acid than CH<sub>3</sub>OH (pK<sub>a</sub> \~ 15) , so
CH<sub>3</sub>O<sup>-</sup> is the stronger base.

Following the same reasoning and using the given approximate
pK<sub>a</sub> values of the conjugate acids, ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)
is a stronger base than acetate (CH<sub>2</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>), and
hydroxide (OH<sup>-</sup>) is a stronger base than acetate.

**E7.3**:

d\)

<img src="media/image95.emf" style="width:4.61111in;height:0.87986in" />

**E7.5**:

The ratio of base to acid is 40/30, or 1.33

log 1.33 = 0.125

pH = 4.8 + 0.125 = **4.9** (to two significant figures)

**E7.6**:

<img src="media/image96.emf" style="width:2.12986in;height:0.94444in" />

**E7.7**:

We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and let the base to acid ratio
be X.

For pH = 2.8:

2.8 = 4.8 + log X

X = 0.01 to 1

 

pH 3.8, the ratio is 0.10 to 1

pH 4.8, the ratio is 1.0 to 1

pH 5.8, the ratio is 10 to 1

pH 6.8, the ratio is 100 to 1

**E7.8**: Phenol has a pK<sub>a</sub> of about 10, so the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation tells us that at pH 2 and 7, it will be
protonated, and thus uncharged and insoluble in the buffer (phenol is
quite nonpolar).  At pH 12 it will be ionized (to the phenolate ion) and
thus soluble (recall that ions are usually very water soluble due to
strong ion-dipole interactions between solute and solvent).

**E7.9**: If we take the pKa of methylamine to be approximately 10, then
we estimate by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation that approximately 10%
of the molecules are in the amine form, and 90% in the ammonium form
(the buffer pH is one unit lower than the pKa of the acid). More
precisely, we can look up the pKa of methylamine in a table to find that
is it 10.7. By the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the ratio of base
(amine) form to acid (ammonium) form is 0.01995 to 1. Thus 19.6% are in
the base form.

**E7.10**: We must consider the protonation state/charge of all
ionizable groups on the peptide - including the terminal amino and
carboxylic acid groups - at pH 7.

terminal amino: +1

Cys: thiol, 0

Asp: carboxylate, -1

Lys: ammonium, +1

Glu: carboxylate, -1

terminal carboxylate: -1

 

Net charge is therefore approximately -1.

**E7.11**:

a\)

<img src="media/image97.emf" style="width:0.76875in;height:0.82431in" />

b\) The negative charge on nitrate, the conjugate base of nitric acid,
is delocalized over three oxygen atoms. Extensive delocalization of the
negative charge over three electronegative atoms lends substantial
stability to the conjugate base, thus nitric acid is a strong acid.

<img src="media/image98.emf" style="width:3.11111in;height:0.88889in" />

**E7.12**: The order is strongest acid A \> B \> C weakest acid.

The two functional groups we see are aldehyde and ammonium/amine. Recall
that aldehydes are not acidic, so we need only consider the
amine/ammonium group. Compound C is not acidic at all - it is an *amine*
(the pKa of an amine is somewhere around 35). Compounds A and B both
contain an *ammonium* group, which is a weak acid. However, consider the
conjugate base of compound A:

<img src="media/image99.emf" style="width:3.17778in;height:0.92222in" />

The lone pair on the conjugate base (amine) can be delocalized as part
of a conjugated system. Remember that electron density delocalization is
a stabilizing effect, and that if a conjugate base is stabilized, the
conjugate acid is *stronger*.

Delocalization is not possible with compound B, due to the different
position of the amine group relative to the alkene. So B is less acidic
than A.

<img src="media/image100.emf" style="width:4in;height:0.94444in" />

style="width:4.30556in;height:1.58333in" />

**E7.14**: *most acidic* A \> C \> B *least acidic*

The inductive effect is strongest in A, because chlorine is more
electronegative than bromine. In C the bromine is closer to the acid
group than in B, so the electron-withdrawing inductive effect in C is
stronger.

**E7.15**:

<img src="media/image104.emf"
style="width:4.51875in;height:1.77778in" />

**E7.16**: The *para*-subsituted phenol is more acidic, because the
negative charge on the conjugate base can be delocalized to the aldehyde
oxygen. This is not possible when the aldehyde group is in the *meta*
position (try drawing curved arrows to convince yourself of this - the
negative charge can be delocalized to ring carbons, but not the aldehyde
oxygen).

<img src="media/image105.emf"
style="width:5.62986in;height:1.79653in" />

**E7.17**: Compound B is the strongest acid due to electron-withdrawing
resonance effects- the negative charge on the conjugate base can be
delocalized to the aldehyde oxygen. Compound A is the 2nd strongest
acid - while the negative charge on the conjugate base *cannot* be
delocalized to the aldehyde oxygen due to the *meta* position (see
previous exercise), the aldehyde nonetheless has a stabilizing,
electron-withdrawing ***inductive*** effect. Compound D is ranked \#3 -
it is phenol, and does not have any electron-withdrawing substituents on
the ring as do B and A. Compound C is the least acidic - neither the
phenyl group nor the aldehyde are even slightly acidic (remember -
aldehyde protons are *not* acidic!)

<img src="media/image106.emf"
style="width:4.72222in;height:1.38889in" />

**E7.18**: The negative charge on the conjugate base of picric acid can
be delocalized to oxygen atoms on *all three* of the nitro groups. One
such resonance contributor is shown below. This extensive delocalization
means that the conjugate base is very stable, and the conjugate acid is
thus a very strong acid.

<img src="media/image107.emf"
style="width:4.16667in;height:1.19444in" />

**E7.19**: The compound on the left has the highest pKa (weakest acid):
the negative charge on the conjugate base is ***de**stabilized* by
resonance with the electron *donating* ether oxygen atom. On the middle
compound, the ether oxygen atom can act as a stabilizing electron
*withdrawing* group by the inductive effect, so this compound has the
lowest pKa (most acidic).

<img src="media/image108.emf"
style="width:3.57431in;height:1.18542in" />

**E7.20**: Compound A is the weaker base. In compound A, a resonance
contributor can be drawn in which the lone pair electrons on the
nitrogen are delocalized as part of a conjugated system which includes
the aldehyde oxygen (in other words, the aldehyde group is acting as a
stabilizing, electron withdrawing group by *resonance* effect).

<img src="media/image109.emf"
style="width:3.35208in;height:1.38889in" />

The same cannot be said for compound B (draw some resonance contributors
to convince yourself!) so the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen are
less stable, that is, more basic.

**E7.21**:

a\)

<img src="media/image110.emf"
style="width:5.22222in;height:1.48889in" />

<img src="media/image111.emf"
style="width:5.90764in;height:2.01875in" />

b\) One of the nitrogen groups in tetrahydrofolate could be considered
an 'extended amide', because a resonance contributor can be drawn in
which there is a separation of charge between the nitrogen and a
carbonyl oxygen, just like for a 'normal' amide. This 'extended amide'
nitrogen, like other amide nitrogens, is not basic, rather it is weakly
acidic, with a pKa in the range of 18-20.

<img src="media/image112.emf"
style="width:4.27778in;height:1.16667in" />

Note that this nitrogen could also be considered as an
'aniline-like'because it is conjugated to an aromatic ring. However, the
stabilizing resonance effect of being conjugated to a carbonyl (the
'amide characteristic') is stronger than the stabilizing resonance
effect of being conjugated to an aromatic ring (the 'aniline
characteristic'), so this nitrogen is likely to have acid/base
properties closer to those of an amide than to those of aniline.

**E7.28**: The carbon is *sp* hybridized, so the same argument discussed
in this section applies. In addition, the nitrogen atom is
electron-withdrawing, which stabilizes the negative charge on the
conjugate base (cyanide ion).

**E7.29**: The diprotonated form of phosphate
(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) has a pKa very close to
physiological pH, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch tells us that in
physiological buffer phosphate will exist mainly as a roughly 50:50
mixture of H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and
HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, with a net charge of approximately -1.5.

**E7.30**: A nonpolar microenvironment will destabilized the cationic
(ammonium) form of lysine, thus making it more favorable to donate a
proton - in other words, the microenvironment will *lower* the pKa of
the side chain.

**E7.31**: The magnesium cation stabilizes the negative charge that
develops on the carbonyl oxygen when an α-proton is abstracted. A more
stable conjugate base, as we know, means a stronger acid, so the pKa of
the α-protons is lowered by the magnesium cation.

(0<sup>o</sup>).

<img src="media/image133.emf"
style="width:5.54444in;height:0.86667in" />

d\) The product is a mixture of *diastereomers*. Because diastereomers
do not necessarily have equal but opposite optical rotations (like
enantiomers do), we cannot predict the optical rotation of the product
mixture.

**E8.5**: Serine is more nucleophilic than tyrosine: on tyrosine, the
electron density on the oxygen atom is delocalized to some extent by
resonance with the aromatic ring, making it less reactive (*ie*. less
nucleophilic) This is the same argument we used to explain why phenol is
a stronger acid than ethanol - the phenolate ion is a weaker base (see
section 7.4). Steric effects (see below) also make tyrosine less
nucleophilic than serine.

**E8.6**: Cysteine (a thiol) is more nucleophilic than methionine (a
sulfide). The bulkier methyl carbon bonded to the methionine sulfur
hinders nucleophilic attack, and in addition the sulfide methyl group on
methionine, unlike the thiol proton on cysteine, cannot be removed by a
base, so the product of nucleophilic attack by a methionine side chain
will have a sulfur with three bonds and a positive formal charge. In
fact, methionine rarely acts as a nucleophile, although an important
exception is in the formation of the cofactor *S*-adenosyl methionine
(see section 8.7A and Exercise 8.18).

Serine (a primary alcohol) is more nucleophilic than threonine (a
secondary alcohol) due to the steric hindrance of the extra methyl group
on threonine.

**E8.7**:

a\) Phenolate, due to electronic effects. Phenolate is the stronger
base, and also the better nucleophile (pKa of phenol is \~10, pKa of
benzoic acid is \~5)

b\) Water (hydronium ion is positively charged, water is neutral)

c\) Trimethylamine (steric effects)

d\) Chloride ion (vertical trend in the context of polar, aprotic
solvent - in a protic solvent like water, iodide ion is more
nucleophilic)

e\) CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>-</sup> : anion more nucleophilic than neutral
amine

f\) Acetate is the stronger base (consider the base-stabilizing
inductive effect of chlorine substituents) and also the better
nucleophile.

g\) 4-methoxyaniline due to electronic effects. Methoxy group is an
electron donating group, making the nitrogen more basic and more
nucleophilic.

h\) Phenolate is less hindered, thus the better nucleophile.

**E8.8**: 1-bromo-3-methylbutane is the less hindered electrophile, and
thus would react faster in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.

<img src="media/image134.emf"
style="width:3.94444in;height:1.19444in" />

**E8.9**: The conjugated *π* system is composed of **7** *p* orbitals
overlapping to share **6** π electrons.

**E8.10**: *most stable* B \> A \> C *least stable.* This is an example
of resonance and inductive effects acting in opposite directions.
Carbocation B is stabilized by resonance with the oxygen atom, which
acts as an electron-donating group by resonance. In A and C, the oxygen
atom cannot be an electron donating group by resonance due to the
relative positions, but it does act as a (carbocation
***de***stabilizing) electron *withdrawing* group by induction, with a
stronger effect seen for C due to closer proximity.

**E8.11**: Recall (section 7.6D) that vinylic carbanions are more stable
than single-bonded carbanions, because increased *s* character in the
hybrid orbitals (sp<sup>2</sup> *vs.* sp<sup>3</sup>) makes the vinylic
carbon more electronegative. The same forces that stabilize a carbanion
will destabilize a carbocation: the vinylic carbon is more
electronegative, and thus is not able to bear a positive charge as well.

fluorine

e\) more stable carbocation can be delocalized by resonance with

**E8.15**:

<img src="media/image138.emf"
style="width:3.77778in;height:1.87986in" />

<u>Reasoning</u>:

a\) thiolates are weaker bases and better leaving groups than alkoxide
(pKa of thiol is \~10; pKa of alcohol is \~15+)

b\) Leaving group is a sulfide vs thiolate. Sulfides are very weak
bases, thus very good leaving groups.

c\) HBr (pKa = -9) is a stronger acid than *para*-toluenesulfonic acid
(pKa = -2.8), so bromide ion is a weaker base and better leaving group
than *para*-toluenesulfonate.

d\) Both are sulfonate leaving groups, but the inductive effect of
fluorines stabilizes the negative charge on the fluorinated leaving
group by inductive effects (see section 7.3C)

**E8.16**: The vertical periodic trend in acidity (section 7.3A) tells
us that thiols are more acidic than alcohols, and thus that thiolates
are weaker bases - and better leaving groups - than alkoxides. By
extension, sulfides are weaker bases than ethers. The sulfide in
*S*-adenosylmethionine is an excellent leaving group, one of several
factors making SAM a very effecting methyl group donor.

**E9.1**:

a\) Compound III contains two phosphate anyhydride linkages, compound IV
contains one.

b\) Compound I contains two phosphate monoesters; compounds II, III, and
IV contain one each.

c\) Compound V contains a phosphate diester.

d\) Compound IV is an organic diphosphate (in contrast, compound I would
be called an organic *bis*phosphate as it has two separate single
phosphate groups).

e\)

I: two bridging, six nonbridging

II: one bridging, three nonbridging

III: three bridging, seven nonbridging

IV: two bridging, five nonbridging

V: two bridging, two nonbridging

**E9.2**: Removing the first proton (pKa<sub>1</sub>) creates a single
(resonance delocalized) negative charge, but removing the second proton
(pKa<sub>2</sub>) is more difficult, as doing so creates a second
negative charge and thus electrostatic repulsion between the two
charges.

**E9.3**: In this buffer pH = pKa<sub>1</sub>, so the first proton will
be gone in about half of the species. Thus half will have a charge of -1
and half will be neutral, so the net charge will be -0.5).

**E9.4**:

We’ll use methyl phosphate as a simple example of a phosphate monoester.
The three major resonance forms show how the three non-bridging oxygens
share a double bond. Another way of putting this is that each of these
bonds is a single σ bond plus 1/3 of a π bond – a bonding order of 1.33.
However, if we also consider the minor resonance form in which the
bridging oxygen is double-bonded (it's a minor form because of the
separation of charge), we can also think of the double bond being
shared, in a small part, by the bridging oxygen. We can approximate
these ideas by saying that the bridging bond order is slightly more than
1, and the non-bridging bond order is slightly less than 1.33.

**E9.8**: This reaction (S<sub>N</sub>2 at a carbon electrophile, *not*
a phosphoryl transfer reaction) does not result in separation of
repulsive negative charges. (However, we have already seen one very
important of this type of reaction - look again at the mechanism for the
generation of *S*-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that you worked out in
Exercise 8.17).

**E9.9**:

a\) We can use a number of alternative abbreviations for ATP and ADP in
showing this mechanism, but the ones used below are relatively compact
and still show the chemistry taking place at the γ-phosphate of ATP:

<img src="media/image143.emf" style="width:5.25in;height:1.30556in" />

b\) The threonine kinase reaction does not involve breaking or forming
any bonds to the two carbon stereocenters, so we do not expect any
changes to stereochemical configuration of threonine.

<img src="media/image144.emf"
style="width:3.60208in;height:1.62986in" />

**E9.10**: A non-bridging oxygen on the β-phosphate of ADP is the
nucleophile, and the leaving group is the carboxylate group of
3-phosphoglycerate.

**E9.11**: This experiment is reported in *J. Biol. Chem*. **1961**
*236*, 2284. The results showed that the <sup>18</sup>O ended up in
inorganic phosphate, leading the researchers to conclude that a
phosphate group transfer mechanism was taking place.

<u>Possibility A</u>: phosphate group transfer mechanism. <sup>18</sup>O
ends up in inorganic phosphate.

<img src="media/image146.emf"
style="width:3.82431in;height:1.38889in" />

**E9.12**: The two protons labeled 'H<sub>c</sub>' are technically *not*
equivalent: they are diastereotopic, either *cis* or *trans* to the
methyl group (with H<sub>d</sub> protons). However, it appears that the
electronic environment of these two H<sub>c</sub> protons are similar
enough that only one signal is observed. With sufficient resolution, we
might be able to see that what appears to be a 'singlet' is actually a
pair of doublets with fine (geminal) coupling of 1-2 Hz.

**E10.8**: It is a question of *entropy* change, which you should recall

**E10.11**: Notice that cellulose is a long straight polymer, while
amylose is curved in shape. Because of it shape, cellulose forms
ordered, rod-shaped crystals with tight packing between individual
polymers - this makes the glycosidic bonds less accessible to cellulase
enzyme. Amylose, with its curved shape, cannot pack closely and so forms
a disordered, amorphous solid, making its glycosidic bonds more
accessible to amylose enzymes. (Do an internet image search for

**E12.4**: The double bond in the product is conjugated to the carbonyl,
whereas the double bond in the substrate is isolated (recall that
conjugation results in more stability). Also, the product has a *trans*
(*E*) double alkene, whereas the substrate has a *cis* (*Z*) alkene
(recall that *trans* alkenes are generally more stable than *cis* due to
steric factors).

proton on the α-carbon of DHAP is abstracted, then the ***re*** face of
the resulting enolate α-carbon attacks the ***re*** face of the aldehyde
carbon of GAP.

b\) In each hypothetical reaction, the nucleophilic and electrophilic
carbons are indicated. Both reactions result in the formation of two new
chiral centers, so each hypothetical product could have four possible

reaction as the carbocation intermediate, rather than undergoing
elimination, is subjected to electrophilic attack by unreacted alkene.
The result of this step is another carbocation, which allows the polymer
to continue growing.

<img src="media/image250.emf" style="width:6in;height:1.16635in" />

b\) Two factors contribute to a driving force for the reaction. First,
the reaction results in the formation of an aromatic ring - reactions
that produce a new aromatic system are almost always thermodynamically
favorable. Second, decarboxylations are inherently energetically
favorable due to the increase in entropy caused by release of a gas
molecule.

it aromaticity, and thus is thermodynamically unfavorable.

b\) The hypothetical carbocation intermediate below, which lead to a
meta substitution product, cannot be stabilized by delocalizing the
positive formal charge on to the oxygen atom. In other words, the oxygen
cannot act as a carbocation-stabilizing electron-donating group.

<img src="media/image259.emf"
style="width:0.90764in;height:1.07431in" />

**E14.20**:

These groups are ring-activating because they stabilize the carbocation
intermediate by resonance:

<img src="media/image260.emf"
style="width:2.55556in;height:2.99097in" />

The ethyl group is ring-activating by inductive effect only (remember
from section 8.3B that increased substitution by alkyl groups will
stabilize a carbocation).

<img src="media/image261.emf"
style="width:1.43542in;height:1.18542in" />

These groups are ring ***de***activating, because the carbonyl acts as
an electron withdrawing group, ***de***stabilizing the carbocation
intermediate.

<img src="media/image262.emf"
style="width:1.76875in;height:1.24097in" />

b\) In the intermediate leading to either the *ortho* or *para* product,
the positive formal charge can be delocalized to a carbon adjacent to
the electron-withdrawing (ring-deactivating) group, where the positive
charge is highly unstable.

<img src="media/image263.emf"
style="width:3.87986in;height:2.57431in" />

However, in the intermediate leading to the meta product, a resonance
contributor *cannot* be drawn in which the positive formal charge is
adjacent to the carbonyl. Thus, the *meta* product is the most abundant.

<img src="media/image264.emf"
style="width:5.01875in;height:1.26875in" />

c\) The carboxylic acid group is ring-deactivating and meta-directing,
and indeed the new substituent ends up *meta* to the carboxylic acid.
The OH group is ring-activating and *ortho/para* directing, and indeed
the new substituent ends up *ortho* to the OH (it cannot end up in the
*para* position as that is already occupied by the carboxylic acid.

**E15.2**: One carbon changes to a higher oxidation state (gains a bond

(gains a bond to hydrogen). The net oxidation change is zero, this this

**E15.6**: The nicotinamide is positioned next to the *re* face of the
ketone (the face we are looking in this figure). Attack of the hydride
at the re face leads to an alcohol with the OH group pointing back into
the plane of the page, which in this case corresponds to *S*
configuration.

<img src="media/image276.emf"
style="width:2.55556in;height:1.12986in" />

**E15.7**: The zinc cation serves as a Lewis acid, accepting electron
density in the carbonyl bond to create a larger partial positive charge
in the carbonyl carbon, which makes this carbon a better electrohile.

**E15.8**: The reaction is part of a biosynthetic pathway, thus we
predict that phosphorylated nicotinamide is used.

**E15.9**:

<img src="media/image278.emf"
style="width:4.29653in;height:2.35208in" />

**E15.10**: The two stereoisomers do not form in an equal ratio because
the starting ketone is part of a fused rig system, and the two faces of
the ketone are *not* equal as is the case in most ketones. It is not
obvious from looking at the camphor structure, but approach of the
reducing agent from the 'top' side is more hindered than from the
'bottom' side, and thus more of isomer A forms than isomer B.
<sup>1</sup>H-NMR can be used to quantify the ratio, because HA and HB
in the two products are in different environments and have different
chemical shifts. Simply integrating under each of these signals gives a
fairly accurate determination of the ratio of the two isomers.

**E15.13**:

a\) For every molecule of substrate that is oxidized, one molecule of
NADP<sup>+</sup> is reduced to NADPH. We can determine the concentration
of NADPH formed by using its extinction coefficient, ε = 6290
M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>.

<img src="media/image283.emf"
style="width:3.12986in;height:0.47222in" />

So the amount of substrate oxidized is (1.53 x 10<sup>-5</sup> M)(1 x
10<sup>-3</sup> L) = 1.53 x 10<sup>-8</sup> moles.

b\) (100 x 10<sup>-6</sup> M) – (1.53 x 10<sup>-5</sup> M) = 8.47 x 10-5
M = 84.7 μM.

than a primary, thus the right side of the ketone migrates.

substrate is a hydrogen (ie. the substrate is an aldehyde).

b\) The carbon indicated by the arrow eventually becomes the α-carbon of

**E17.6**: In general, reactions involving decarboxylation steps are
essentially irreversible due to the large entropic driving force of the
'freeing' of a gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> molecule.

**E17.7**: (For the sake of clarity, curved arrows are not drawn and
mechanistic steps are combined). This first part of this reaction is
ThDP-facilitated decarboxylation:

<img src="media/image299.emf" style="width:6in;height:1.53463in" />

The ThDP-stabilized carbanion intermediate then acts as a (carbon)
nucleophile in a conjugate (Michael) addition step, followed by
expulsion of the coenzyme:

<img src="media/image300.emf" style="width:6in;height:3.86386in" />

Finally, elimination of the enol form of pyruvate occurs via an E1cb

<img src="media/image302.emf" style="width:6in;height:4.00579in" />

**E17.9**: The glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase reaction would
be expected to inherently more kinetically favorable because the
nucleophile is a primary amine. In contrast, the nucleophile in the
aminoimidazole carboxamide transformylase reaction is an 'pyrrole-like'
/ 'aniline-like' nitrogen in the sense that the nitrogen lone pair
electrons are stabilized by resonance with the carbonyl group as well as
the aromatic ring (see section 7.5). Therefore, this nitrogen is less
basic - and less nucleophilic - than a primary amine.
