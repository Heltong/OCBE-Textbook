**P2.12:** The amide below is not capable of acting as a hydrogen bond
donor (it does not have any N-H bonds), and thus is expected to be less
soluble in water. The other three amides of the same formula have one or
more N-H bonds, and can thus participate in hydrogen bonding with water
as both donor and acceptor.

**  
**

**P2.19:**

a\)

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image24.png" style="width:2.62222in;height:0.43333in" />

2 and 3 have two fluorines and are more polar than 1, so they have
stronger intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. 3 has one more
carbon than 2, and therefore stronger van der Waals interactions. 4 is
capable of hydrogen bonding, so it has the strongest intermolecular
interactions and the highest boiling point.

b\)

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image25.png" style="width:3.73333in;height:1.03333in" />

1 and 2 have only van der Waals interactions, but 2 has more carbons so
these interactions are slightly stronger. 3 has a polar carbonyl group,
and 4 is capable of hydrogen bonding.

c\)

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image26.png" style="width:2.78889in;height:1.03333in" />

1 is not capable of hydrogen bonding. 2 and 3 both have hydrogen bonding
groups, but 3 has one more carbon and therefore stronger overall van der
Waals interactions.

d\)

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image27.png" style="width:3.48889in;height:1.03333in" />

1 has only van der Waals interactions. 2 has a polar thiol group, but 3
has a hydroxyl group which is capable of hydrogen bonding. 4 is a salt:
the charge-charge interactions are very strong and lead to a very high
boiling point.

**P2.20:**

a\) The compound on the right is more soluble (fewer hydrophobic
carbons)

b\) The compound on the left is more soluble (ionic phosphate group)

c\) The compound on the left is more soluble (fewer hydrophobic carbons)

d\) The compound on the left is more soluble (capable of hydrogen
bonding)

e\) The compound on the right is more soluble (fewer hydrophobic
carbons)

**P2.22:** The lone pair electrons on the peptide nitrogen are
conjugated to the carbonyl π bond, and thus are not available to act as
hydrogen bond acceptors.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image28.png" style="width:3.44444in;height:1.81111in" />

**P2.23**: Both bonds are the same length, and have a bond order of 1.5
(one part single bond, one part double bond). The central oxygen is
sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image29.png" style="width:2.11111in;height:0.45556in" />

**P2.26**: The five-membered ring is *not* part of the aromatic system,
due to the presence of an sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon in the ring.

**P2.27:**

A is *not* aromatic (sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized carbon in the ring)

B is aromatic (count the lone pair and you get 10 π electrons, which is
a Huckel number)

C is *not* aromatic (the 2*p* orbital on the carbocation is empty, thus
there are only four π electrons in the system, which is not a Huckel
number)

D is *not* aromatic (four π electrons, not a Huckel number)

E is *not* aromatic (sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized carbon in the ring)

F is *not* aromatic (sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized carbon in the ring)

G is *not* aromatic (lone pair electrons count as part of π system, thus
there are four π electrons which is not a Huckel number.

H is aromatic (carbocation is sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized, the 2*p*
orbital is empty, so there are two π electrons in the system, and 2 is a
Huckel number)

I is *not* aromatic (there are three conjugated p bonds with six p
electrons in the system, but the compound is not cyclic).

# Chapter 3

**P3.7:**

a\) Stereocenters are marked with a bold dot.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image33.png" style="width:5.88889in;height:1.50903in" />

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image34.png" style="width:5.62986in;height:2.00903in" />

fig 6

b\) The two fluorinated derivatives of Epivar are enantiomers.

**P3.9:**

a\) There is only one stereocenter, and it is in the *R* configuration.

b\)

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image35.png" style="width:3.82431in;height:1.69444in" />

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image37.png" style="width:4.88889in;height:1.99097in" />

fig 8

**P3.12:** The two are diastereomers: two of the four stereocenters are
different.

**  
**

**P3.16:**

a\) The molecule contains two stereocenters and has no alkene groups
that can be classified *E* or *Z*; therefore, there are four possible
stereoisomers.

b\) Positions of prochiral hydrogens are indicated with arrows.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image38.png" style="width:2.41667in;height:2.21319in" />

fig 8

**P3.17:**

a\) The two structures are diastereomeric.

b\) The five-membered ring is sandwiched between the aromatic,
seven-membered, and six-membered rings, with the ether oxygen as the
free corner.

**P3.18:**

a\) Both alkene groups are *E*.

b\) In addition to the two alkene groups, there are 10 chiral carbons in
the molecule. Therefore, there are 2<sup>12</sup> possible
stereoisomers.

**P 3.19:**

a\)

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image39.png" style="width:1.92569in;height:1.11111in" />

b\) The *gauche* conformation makes possible the formation of an
energetically-favorable intramolecular hydrogen bond (a model will help
you to see this).

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image40.png" style="width:0.79653in;height:0.92569in" />

c\) When the hydroxy groups are changed to methoxy groups,
intramolecular hydrogen bonding is no longer possible, and the *anti*
conformation is expected to be lowest in energy.

**P3.21:**

These two structures are actually enantiomers – they are
non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Notice that, even though
there is no sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized carbon, the overall geometry of
the allene structure creates a multi-atom stereocenter.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image41.png" style="width:2.37986in;height:1.33333in" />

# Chapter 4

**P4.1:**

Without doing any calculation, we can answer the first part of the
calculation: electromagnetic waves at 3400 cm<sup>-1</sup> are shorter
than those at 1690 cm<sup>-1</sup> (more waves fit into one centimeter)
and thus correspond to a higher frequency.

3400 cm<sup>-1</sup> = 2.94 μm = 1.02 x 10<sup>14</sup> Hz

1690 cm<sup>-1</sup> = 5.92 μm = 5.07 x 10<sup>13</sup> Hz

**P4.2:**

1720 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to a wavelength of .01/1720 = 5.81 x
10<sup>-6</sup> m, and an energy of 4.92 kcal/mol.

**P4.3:**

The triple bond in compound I is symmetric, and therefore is not
IR-active, so there would be no absorbance in the carbon-carbon triple
bond range (2100-2250 cm<sup>-1</sup>). In compound II the presence of
the fluorines makes the triple bond asymmetric and IR-active, thus the
alkyne peak will be observed. In compound III, we should see not only
the carbon-carbon triple bond peak but also an absorbance at
approximately 3300 cm<sup>-1</sup> due to stretching of the terminal
alkyne carbon-hydrogen bond.

**P4.4:**

All three spectra will have a strong carbonyl stretching peak, but the
ester (compound C) carbonyl peak will be observed at a shorter
wavelength compared to the ketone (compound B) and the carboxylic acid
(compound A). In addition, Compound A will show a broad absorbance
centered at approximately 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup> due to carboxylic acid
O-H stretching, whereas in the spectrum of compound B we should see the
broad absorbance centered at approximately 3300 cm<sup>-1</sup> from
stretching of the alcohol O-H bond. Compound C will have no broad O-H
stretching absorbance.

**P4.5:**

All three compounds contain alkene functional groups. However, in
compound Y the alkene is symmetric and thus we would not expect to see
an absorbance from C=C stretching in the 1620-1680 cm<sup>-1</sup>range.
We *would* expect to see this peak in the spectra of compounds X and Z;
in addition we would expect to see, in the compound X spectrum, a peak
in the 3020 - 3080 cm<sup>-1</sup> range due to stretching of the
terminal alkene C-H bonds.

**P4.6:**

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image42.png" style="width:4.00903in;height:0.40764in" />

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image43.png" style="width:5.09236in;height:0.24097in" />

**P4.7:**

The change in A<sub>340</sub> is ∆A = 0.220. Using the expression ε =
A/c, we can calculate that this represents a change in the NADH
concentration of 3.50 x 10<sup>-5</sup> M. This is in a 1 mL solution,
so 3.50 x 10<sup>-8</sup> mol have been used up over the course of five
minutes, or 7.00 x 10<sup>-9</sup> mol (7.00 nmol) per minute on
average.

**P4.8:**

Both starting compounds contain systems of conjugated π bonds which
absorb in the UV range. The condensation reaction brings these two
conjugated systems together to create a single, longer conjugated
π system, which absorbs in the blue part of the visible spectrum.

**P4.9:**

Both molecules contain alkene and ketone functional groups, however the
degree of π bond conjugation is different. Therefore, UV would be the
more useful technique to distinguish the two.

**P4.10:**

Both molecules are straight-chain alkanes with a single ketone group, so
their IR spectra are expected to be very similar and neither will absorb
strongly in the UV range. However, the different positions of the ketone
(at the C<sub>4</sub> vs C<sub>5</sub> position) will result in the
formation of fragments of different masses in an MS experiment.

**P5.10:** The structure is 3-methyl-2-butanone.

**P5.11:** First, assign the peaks.

*1-bromopropane*: Ha is the triplet at 3.4 ppm, Hb is the sextet at 1.9
ppm, Hc is the triplet at 1.0 ppm.

*2-bromopropane*: Hd is the doublet at 1.7 ppm, He is the septet at 4.3
ppm.

Now, just add up the integrations for each molecule and figure the
percentage.

1-bromopropane: 0.661 + 0.665 + 1.00 = 2.326.

2-bromopropane: 0.0735 + 0.441 = 0.5145.

Percent 2-bromopropane is (0.5145)\*100 / (0.5145 + 2.326) = 18.1%.

Notice that even if some peaks overlapped, you could still get this
number as long as you could integrate one signal on each molecule: you
could, for example, do the same calculation (and get the same result) by
comparing integrations of Hc and Hd signals, and just scale based on the
fact that the Hc signal represents three protons while the Hd signal
represents six protons.

**P7.4:** One nitrogen is simply a primary amine, and as such is basic.
The other nitrogen is ‘pyrrole-like’, meaning that its lone pair is part
of an aromatic sextet, and is not available for bonding to another
proton.

**P7.6:** Of the four protons, H<sub>a</sub> is the least acidic. The
negative charge that results from abstraction of H<sub>a</sub> can be
delocalized to only one oxygen atom, whereas the charge resulting from
abstraction of either H<sub>b</sub>, H<sub>c</sub>, and H<sub>d</sub>
can be delocalized to two oxygens in each case.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image63.png" style="width:1.41667in;height:1.42569in" />

fig 6

**P7.7:** The total charge will be very close to –3.0. At pH = 7.3, the
N-terminus proline (pK<sub>a</sub> = 10.6) will be fully protonated, and
will contribute a charge of +1. This is balanced, however, by a negative
charge on the terminal glutamate (pKa = 2.2). Three of the seven amino
acids in the peptide have ionizable side chains: an aspartate (D) and
two glutamates (E). The pK<sub>a</sub> values for these side chains are
3.7 and 4.3, respectively, so at pH 7 all three will be fully ionized,
leading to a total peptide charge of –3.

**P7.8:** There are three ionizable groups on this peptide: the terminal
amino group on Asp (pK<sub>a</sub> \~ 9.6), the side-chain carboxylate
group on Asp (pK<sub>a</sub> \~ 3.7) and the terminal carboxylate on Ile
(pK<sub>a</sub> \~ 2.4). For each buffer, we can use the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to determine the charged / uncharged
ratio for each group.

a\) At pH = 4.0:

Asp (terminal amino) \[HA<sup>+</sup>\] / \[A\] = 10<sup>(9.6-4.0)</sup>
= 10<sup>5.6</sup> = 4.0 x 10<sup>5</sup>. At this pH the terminal amino
group is essentially 100% protonated and positively charged, so this
group contributes a charge of +1.

Asp (side chain): \[HA\] / \[A<sup>-</sup>\] = 10<sup>(3.7 - 4.0)</sup>
= 10<sup>(-0.3)</sup> = 0.50. Approximately 2 out of every 3 side chains
is deprotonated and negatively charged, so overall this group
contributes a charge of -0.67.

Ile (terminal carboxylate): ): \[HA\] / \[A<sup>-</sup>\] =
10<sup>(2.4 - 4.0)</sup> = 10<sup>(-1.6)</sup> = 0.025. Most, but not
all of the terminal carboxylates are deprotonated and negatively
charged. We can calculate the percentage that are protonated:

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image64.png" style="width:1.94444in;height:0.44444in" />

. . .thus about 97.6% are deprotonated and negatively charged. This
group contributes an overall charge of -0.98.

In a buffer of pH 4.0, the total charge on the dipeptide will be:

(+1) + (-0.67) + (-0.98) = -0.65.

b\) in a buffer with pH = 7.3, the total charge on the dipeptide will be
close to -2 (the terminal amino group is 100% protonated, both
carboxylate groups are 100% deprotonated)

c\) in a buffer with pH = 9.6, the total charge on the dipeptide will be
close to -2.5 (in this basic buffer, the terminal amino group is 50%
deprotonated, and so only contributes a charge of +0.5).

**P7.9:**

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image65.png" style="width:5.24097in;height:1.36111in" />

K<sub>eq</sub> = 10<sup>-8.2</sup> = 6.3 x 10<sup>-9</sup>

fig 6

How did we pick the most basic group on the Y species? We have four
choices: a primary amine, a 'pyrrole-like' amine, and two carboxylates.
We know that pyrrole-like amines are not basic, and we can look at our
pK<sub>a</sub> table to remind ourselves that primary amines are more
basic than carboxylates.

**P7.11:**

a\) The most acidic proton on tetracycline is indicated below. Notice
that the negative charge on the conjugate base can be delocalized to
*two* carbonyl oxygens.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image69.png" style="width:5.72222in;height:3.58333in" />

fig 4

**P7.13:** In all cases the pK<sub>a</sub> of the amino acid side chain
(or of water, for part e) is expected to be *lower* due to the proximity
of the cationic magnesium ion. The positive charge on the metal ion is
expected to stabilize the negatively-charged conjugate base form of Glu,
Tyr, and water, and to destabilize the positively charged, conjugate
acid forms of Lys and His.

**P7.14:** The positive charge on the protonated form of arginine can be
delocalized by resonance to all three of the nitrogens – this stabilizes
the conjugate acid form (ie. makes it a weaker acid). On the protonated
form of lysine, by contrast, the positive charge is ‘stuck’ on the
single nitrogen (see the structure of lysine in chapter 6). Because the
positive charge of of lysine is not stabilized by resonance, lysine is
more likely to give up a proton and lose the charge.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image70.png" style="width:3.61111in;height:2.74097in" />

fig 2

**P7.15:** The ester oxygen acts as an electron-donating group by
resonance. This electron-donating property *destabilizes* the negative
charge on the enolate form, making the α-proton *less* acidic. This
argument also holds true for thioesters.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image71.png" style="width:4.65764in;height:1.99097in" />

**P7.16:**

Tris: Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we find that the ratio
\[HA<sup>+</sup>\] / \[A\] at this pH is 10<sup>(8.1-7.0)</sup> =
10<sup>1.1</sup> = 12.6. The percentage of HA<sup>+</sup> is thus
(12.6/13.6)\*100 = 93%. The concentration of protonated (positively
charged) Tris is (0.93)(50 mM) = 46.5 mM.

Imidazolium: The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation tells us that the buffer
is 50% protonated at pH 7 (this is always true when the pH of the
solution equals the pKa of the buffer compound), so the concentration of
the protonated form (imidazolium) is 25 mM.

# Chapter 8

**P8.1:** All of the molecules in question are primary alkyl bromides,
and the nucleophile is a very powerful thiolate ion – we are talking
here about SN<sup>2</sup> reactions. The rate of substitution depends on
the amount of steric hindrance in the electrophile – the less hindrance,
the faster the substitution reaction. The order is:

fastest D \> B \> A \> C \> slowest

**P8.4:** Here we are looking at periodic trends and steric hindrance.
Nucleophilicity increases going down a column of the periodic table, so
A and C, with phosphorus atoms, are expected to be more nucleophilic
than B and D. C is more nucleophilic than A, because the three methyl
groups on C are the cause of less steric hindrance than the three ethyl
groups on A. Using the same reasoning, we can see that B should be more
nucleophilic than D, because of the bulky phenyl group on D. The trend
is:

most nucleophilic C \> A \> B \> D least nucleophilic

**P8.12:** The first step in an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is carbocation
formation. However, the rigid ‘bicyclo’ structure of the starting
material prevents a hypothetical carbocation intermedia/EOC_solutionste from adopting
trigonal planar geometry (make a model to see this better).
Consequently, there is a large energy barrier for carbocation formation.

than attack by the water molecule at a phosphorus.

a\) The cysteine could attack the <sup>14</sup>C atom, with subsequent
loss of N<sub>2</sub> gas (this would be a very entropically favored
step - we will see similar reaction types when we study decarboxylation
mechanisms). This process would result in the <sup>14</sup>C label
becoming attached to the active site cysteine.

b\) The cysteine could also attack the carbonyl carbon, in what is
essentially an acyl transfer reaction. In this case, the cysteine would
not receive the radioactive <sup>14</sup>C label.

we would see NMR signals in the 2-3 ppm range.

addition.

**P14.13:**

<u>Methyl vinyl ketone:</u>

The NMR data shows that the main product is from anti-Markovnikov
addition of HBr. This regiochemistry is due to the electron-withdrawing
effect of the carbonyl group, which makes the primary carbocation
intermedia/EOC_solutionste more stable than the secondary carbocation.

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image146.png"
style="width:5.49097in;height:0.97222in" />

If the reaction were to proceed with Markovnikov regiochemistry, the NMR
spectrum of the product would look very different:

Addition can take place with either Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov
regiochemistry:

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image148.png"
style="width:5.36111in;height:2.44444in" />

NMR data shows that it is the anti-Markovnikov product that forms, due
to the electron-withdrawing effect of the ester carbonyl. (The
<sup>1</sup>H spectrum of the Markovnikov product would be expected to
contain just two singlet signals.)

Peak assignments are given below. Notice that the the H<sub>R</sub> and
H<sub>S</sub> protons are diastereotopic (there is a stereocenter in the
molecule) and have different chemical shifts. These signals show dd
splitting because H<sub>R</sub> and H<sub>S</sub> are coupled to each
other, and also to the proton at 2.3 ppm.

**P17.2:** The *bis*-acylamide molecule has two alkene groups, at either
end, that can participate in radical chain elongation reactions. This
allows it to tie two growing polyacrylamide strands together (ie to form
a cross-link):

<img src="media/EOC_solutions/image184.png" style="width:3.67569in;height:1.5in" />

Here is a more detailed mechanism. We start with a growing
polyacrylamide strand (strand 1) reacting in a chain propagation
reaction with a bis-acrylamide molecule. In the next, step, the
remaining alkene group on bis-acrylamide reacts adds to a second growing
polyacrylamide strand (strand 2).

Notice that the radical form of resveratrol shown above is more stable,
compared to a radical species in which the unpaired electron is located
on one of the 'lower' phenoxy groups. The extra stability is due to
resonance - the unpaired electron can be delocalized over both of the
aromatic rings. (Consider the two other alternative radical species
below - in these cases, the unpaired electron cannot be delocalized over
both rings! It all comes back to *para* vs. *meta* positioning on the
aromatic ring.)
