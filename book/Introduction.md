**Notes to the reader:**

This textbook is intended for a sophomore-level, two-semester course in
Organic Chemistry targeted at Biology, Biochemistry, and Health Science
majors. It is assumed that readers have taken a year of General
Chemistry and college level Introductory Biology, and are concurrently
enrolled in the typical Biology curriculum for sophomore Biology/Health
Sciences majors.

This textbook is meant to be a constantly evolving work in progress, and
as such, feedback from students, instructors, and all other readers is
greatly appreciated. Please send any comments, suggestions, or
notification of errors to the author at soderbt@morris.umn.edu.

If you are looking at a black and white printed version of this
textbook, please be aware that most of the figures throughout are meant
to contain color, which is used to help the reader to understand the
concepts being illustrated. It will often be very helpful to refer to
the full-color figures in a digital version of the book, either at the
Chemwiki site (see below) or in a PDF version which is available for
free download at:

An online version is accessible as part of the **Chemwiki** project at
the University of California, Davis:

This online version contains some additional hyperlinks to animations,
interactive 3D figures, and online lectures that you may find useful.
*Note*: The online (Chemwiki) version currently corresponds to the older
(2012) edition of this textbook. It is scheduled to be updated to this
2016 edition during the spring and summer of 2016.

*Where is the index?* There is no printed index. However, an electronic
index is available simply by opening the digital (pdf) version of the
text (see above) and using the 'find' or 'search' function of your pdf
viewer.
